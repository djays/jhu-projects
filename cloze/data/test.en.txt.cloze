Sometimes , debt @-@ service payments <blank> rescheduled and perhaps stretched out over a longer period , thus giving the debtor <blank> time to regain its ability to pay .
Sometimes , creditors agree to exchange <blank> old bonds for new ones , which have either a lower face value <blank> lower interest payments .
Few governments refuse to pay <blank> all in any form .
After several difficult <blank> , the country managed to negotiate an exchange of outstanding bonds <blank> bonds with a considerably lower face value .
About 93 % <blank> creditors accepted the exchange and received new bonds <blank> a face value that was about one @-@ quarter of that of the old bonds .
After 2005 , Argentina maintained debt service <blank> the new bonds .
<blank> some creditors held out , and sued Argentina in New York ( as <blank> bonds were issued under New York law ) .
Argentine bonds ( like most others ) had a so @-@ <blank> pari passu clause <blank> committed the government to treat all bondholders alike .
The holdouts claimed that , <blank> the new bonds were being serviced in full ( as they were ) , equal treatment required that the holdouts <blank> receive the full amount owed to them ( including not only interest but <blank> principal ) .
The US Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Argentina was bound to honor its obligations <blank> <blank> holdout bondholders in the same proportion ( namely 100 % ) as the holders of the exchange bonds .
It was <blank> ruling that the Supreme Court recently upheld .
Under the court order , Argentina may <blank> pay the holders of the new bonds unless it also pays the holdouts , <blank> no US <blank> institution can serve as an intermediary to make payments for Argentina .
As <blank> result , Argentina must either pay the holdouts in full or default on the new bonds .
Regardless of how the current impasse <blank> resolved , the ruling raises <blank> questions for issuers and holders of sovereign debt .
<blank> creditors now believe that holding out makes it more likely <blank> they will receive full value <blank> a later date , restructuring sovereign debt and restoring a debtor economy &apos;s normal functioning will be more difficult .
Since the Argentine crisis , <blank> <blank> bonds have been issued with collective action clauses ( CACs ) , under which bondholders are obliged to accept restructuring if a specified share ( usually around 70 % ) agree to it .
As time passes , there are fewer and fewer outstanding bonds that <blank> not contain CACs .
But CACs may not resolve the problem entirely , because a vote would be required <blank> each separate bond issue , and a holdout position could be achieved by buying up the blocking percentage <blank> a small <blank> .
It is <blank> possible that language will be found in <blank> bond issues that replaces the pari passu clause but provides sufficient assurance to bondholders to let <blank> market function much as it did until the current ruling .
Until the euro crisis , it was generally believed <blank> problems servicing sovereign debt occurred only in <blank> markets and the least developed countries .
The US Supreme Court &apos;s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle , and may well further <blank> the risk attached to holding sovereign debt - and <blank> to <blank> cost of issuing it .
WASHINGTON , DC - It is graduation season in many countries , a time when classes of bright and fortunate young people don their caps and gowns , receive their diplomas , <blank> hear advice <blank> their elders .
Some commencement speakers focus on the graduates &quot; accomplishments ; others emphasize the career @-@ related <blank> that lie ahead .
But there is another critical aspect to success and happiness <blank> is <blank> overlooked during these garlanded celebrations of academic achievement : family .
<blank> fact , these ceremonies are about the graduates &quot; families - that is , those who <blank> loved and supported <blank> , regardless of their biological connection - as much as they are about the graduates themselves .
Whatever each family &apos;s experience , the result has been <blank> child reaching a level of education of <blank> many people can only dream .
Beyond noting and appreciating what their families have done for them , graduates <blank> consider <blank> kind of family that they want to nurture .
And here they have no choice <blank> to reflect on gender roles and relations .
Given the vastly different expectations and experiences of men and women - depending , of course , on the cultural context - <blank> questions <blank> they must ask themselves vary considerably .
<blank> question of how to balance work <blank> family , typically posed to young women , is actually a critical consideration for young men as well .
The traditional male role <blank> &quot; provider &quot; has often led work to take precedence <blank> time spent with family .
Indeed , in reflecting on their childhoods , many graduates may lament that their fathers spent too little <blank> at <blank> , or <blank> less nurturing than they could have been .
Men must determine how to develop <blank> caring side of their personality , in addition to the competitive side that will enable them to advance <blank> careers .
They must aim to love and give fully , not <blank> as fathers , <blank> also as sons , husbands , brothers , uncles , and even friends .
To this <blank> , they should ask their own fathers and grandfathers what they wish they had done differently - <blank> plan accordingly .
Instead of waiting for challenges <blank> arise , young men should begin establishing their priorities now .
How can they ensure that <blank> relationship with their future partner is equal ?
How <blank> they adapt to enable their partner to fulfill his or her career aspirations ?
Will <blank> be willing to move for their partner &apos;s job ?
Would they be prepared <blank> stop working or reduce their workload , in order to care <blank> a child or parent ?
Through all of <blank> , men should remember that , by adopting <blank> new approach , they are not abandoning their roles as providers .
After all , providing care <blank> every bit as important as providing cash .
The reward is <blank> close relationship with their children that women have traditionally enjoyed .
Women , too , must think carefully about the <blank> that they would find most fulfilling .
For many women , the challenge is abandoning the assumption that their work / family balance will have <blank> tip in favor of family , that it is they who will <blank> <blank> sacrifice their careers .
<blank> course , many women might choose to emphasize family ( as would many men ) .
<blank> point is the choice : the choice of how much energy to devote to one &apos;s <blank> , <blank> choice of a career based on passion , and the choice of a genuinely equal partner .
Upholding <blank> equal partnership of caregivers and breadwinners will require compromises on both sides .
A woman with great career ambitions should be able to find <blank> partner who is willing to slow down or stop working to <blank> her , just as a man should .
<blank> , for such <blank> dynamic to work , the woman must recalibrate her expectations of her spouse .
If she wants to build <blank> family with a man , she <blank> not become caught up in traditional perceptions of masculinity .
<blank> she is uncomfortable , say , out @-@ earning her husband , she is limiting both partners .
Simply <blank> , the kind of support that young women &apos;s fathers and grandfathers probably offered to their mothers and grandmothers is not the only kind of support a woman <blank> or should expect <blank> her partner .
Her role should <blank> determined not by old @-@ fashioned rules , but by her individual strengths and ambitions .
And her partner <blank> have the confidence and competence to encourage her <blank> fulfill her potential .
Finally , graduation does not mean that <blank> family &apos;s job is complete .
Parents and grandparents must continue <blank> play a critical role <blank> reshaping expectations - or at least supporting the choices that their children and grandchildren make .
<blank> means accepting the decision of a son or grandson not to use his hard @-@ earned university degree to become the primary breadwinner <blank> his future household .
And <blank> means understanding that what a daughter <blank> granddaughter needs may not be a traditional &quot; provider , &quot; but a partner who makes career sacrifices to enable her to advance hers .
It <blank> a day for young people to recall the sacrifices <blank> their families have made for them , and consider the kinds <blank> sacrifices they will make for their families .
And it is a day <blank> recognize that , if family comes first , work does <blank> come second ; rather , life comes together .
WASHINGTON , DC - The United States <blank> &apos;s initial statements on the &quot; first @-@ step agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program &quot; have been focused , above all , on the great deal that the US and <blank> <blank> have gotten .
Iran has agreed to halt enrichment <blank> uranium above 5 % purity ; neutralize its stockpile of uranium enriched to near 20 % purity ; stop building its stockpile of 3.5 % enriched uranium ; forswear &quot; next generation centrifuges &quot; ; shut down <blank> plutonium reactor ; and allow extensive new inspections of its nuclear facilities .
In return , Iran will get &quot; limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible relief &quot; <blank> international sanctions .
The agreement covers <blank> the next six months , during which both sides will try <blank> reach a final comprehensive agreement .
For now , as President Barack Obama put it , the burden remains , from the US point <blank> view , &quot; on Iran to prove <blank> the world that <blank> nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes . &quot;
Framing the issue this way reflects <blank> need to sell even <blank> limited , temporary deal to a skeptical US Congress .
Israel &apos;s manifest displeasure with the entire negotiating process , which Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has emphasized to anyone who will listen over the past <blank> months , reverberates loudly <blank> Israel &apos;s many congressional friends .
Indeed , Israel &apos;s stance bolsters the desire of Obama &apos;s Republican opponents to paint him as weak and naïve in negotiating <blank> Iran , <blank> country that still describes the <blank> as &quot; the great Satan . &quot;
Both Republicans and Democrats are threatening <blank> pass a new round of tough sanctions against Iran in December .
Thus , Obama must focus as much on pushing back against domestic hardliners <blank> on taking <blank> hard line with Iranian negotiators .
One hopes that the Iranian government &apos;s announcement to its own <blank> reads roughly the same , in reverse , focusing on the <blank> concessions that Iranian negotiators have won .
<blank> includes suspension of international sanctions <blank> Iran &apos;s exports of oil , gold , and cars , which could yield $ 1.5 billion in revenue ; unfreezing $ 4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales ; and releasing tuition @-@ assistance payments from <blank> Iranian government to Iranian students enrolled abroad .
Iranian <blank> Hassan Rouhani needs to marshal support for the deal just as much as Obama does , above all by reducing inflation <blank> getting his country &apos;s economy moving again .
If domestic tensions , above all within Iran &apos;s restive middle class , ease as a result , the government <blank> receive <blank> credit , while the Iranian Republican Guard and other hardliners will be weakened .
The West <blank> better hope that <blank> Iranian narrative proves true , because the political space for <blank> meaningful diplomatic agreement - both the desire for a deal and the room to achieve it - is created at home .
This is particularly true <blank> a new government comes to power with promises <blank> improving the economy .
Rouhani can undercut hardliners who would seek <blank> block any ultimate deal only if the Iranian population both experiences economic relief <blank> attributes it to his administration .
The true test of this interim agreement , therefore , is whether both sides can secure <blank> domestic space to <blank> negotiating .
The stakes have never been <blank> - and not <blank> because of the very real and dangerous geopolitical consequences of an Iranian bomb .
<blank> Obama <blank> it , &quot; If Iran seizes this opportunity , the Iranian people will benefit <blank> rejoining the international community , and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations .
This <blank> provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with <blank> wider world based on mutual respect . &quot;
Let us imagine , <blank> for a moment , what the Middle East and Central Asia <blank> look like if the <blank> and Iran could once again talk to each other .
As we saw briefly after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the drug trade <blank> <blank> could be sharply curtailed .
Moreover , a regional <blank> involving Iran , India , Pakistan , Russia , China , Turkey , the European Union , and the US would become much more likely , providing the framework for security and economic growth that diplomats from Henry Kissinger to the late Richard Holbrooke always claimed <blank> be necessary for lasting <blank> in Afghanistan .
Perhaps most important , a peace settlement in Syria would be much <blank> likely - and more likely to endure - if <blank> US could talk to Iran , which has far more leverage with President Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime <blank> Russia does .
After all , <blank> was fighters from Hezbollah , <blank> &apos;s Lebanese proxy , who turned the tide of battle decisively against the opposition this past summer .
Iran has long made clear that it wants to resume its historic position as a <blank> regional - <blank> indeed global - power , an ambition that can only grow stronger <blank> it watches Turkey &apos;s geopolitical stature rise .
Iran and Turkey , after <blank> , are the 17th and 18th largest countries in the world by population , respectively , <blank> sophisticated elites and illustrious and ancient pasts .
The ultimate winner in the interim agreement with <blank> is the cause of diplomacy itself .
US Secretary of State John Kerry , EU High Representative Catherine Ashton , and the <blank> parties to the talks - all supported by able teams <blank> diplomats - hammered out the deal &apos;s details over months , staying at the table , compromising , holding firm , and managing the expectations <blank> multiple players ( including the press ) .
The <blank> administration committed itself to global leadership <blank> civilian rather than military power .
WASHINGTON , DC - US President Barack Obama has laid out a detailed strategy for <blank> his administration plans to combat the Islamic State , which controls a substantial portion <blank> Syria and Iraq .
Though I have been harshly critical of Obama &apos;s policy toward Syria for two and a half years , his new strategy reflects a mature and coherent foreign <blank> - albeit one that does <blank> fully live up <blank> his proclaimed values .
Second , it attaches careful conditions to the type and scope of American military <blank> .
Third , it ties <blank> fate of these efforts to the existence and effectiveness <blank> <blank> broad Middle East coalition , making clear that though the United States is prepared to lead , it cannot and will not assume the role of global policeman .
In <blank> Middle East game of thrones , Obama is playing his hand as <blank> as he can .
He knows <blank> a US @-@ led military effort <blank> significantly weaken the Islamic State , but that only a combined military @-@ political effort can defeat it .
He created political leverage for himself by drawing a <blank> line , announcing that the US would &quot; expand our <blank> beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions &quot; only <blank> with the newly @-@ formed Iraqi government .
If that government makes good on its promises of political inclusion , the US will help it get its <blank> back ; if <blank> , not .
Equally important , but less evident , is the leverage that <blank> position provides with respect to Iran .
<blank> never mentioned Iran during his speech ; but commentators have speculated about whether his strategy gives <blank> greater leverage over the US , on the theory that Iranian @-@ backed fighters are critical to <blank> success on the ground in the fight against the Islamic State .
But Iraq &apos;s Shia <blank> is one of Iran &apos;s <blank> strategic anchors in the region ; before the US began airstrikes against the Islamic State , <blank> was far from certain that the Iraqi government would survive .
Iran needs US airpower at least as <blank> as the US <blank> Iranian @-@ backed ground troops .
The US emphasis on a regional coalition <blank> fight the Islamic State is also deft diplomacy .
Secretary of State John Kerry has <blank> it &amp; nbsp ; clear <blank> for now Iran is not a welcome member .
Iran , without which the coalition essentially becomes a Sunni front , can <blank> a place <blank> the table - and play a large and overt <blank> in resolving the Syrian civil war - but only if it is willing to reach a deal to rein in its nuclear program .
There has never <blank> a better time to do so .
Where Obama &apos;s strategy <blank> weakest is in reaching ordinary people : the networked web <blank> human relationships that transmits rage , hatred , and despair or hope , trust , and loyalty .
His doctrine <blank> the <blank> will use force to defend its &quot; core interests , &quot; but will mobilize others &quot; to address broader challenges to international order , &quot; is sound logic and <blank> politics in a war @-@ weary US .
But , as a Syrian tweeted <blank> me , what the world hears Obama saying is that the US <blank> use force <blank> avenge the deaths of two American journalists , but will stand by while 200,000 Syrians are slaughtered .
Unless US military action is seen as actually protecting the lives and property of <blank> Iraqi and Syrian people , the US will quickly lose the propaganda war <blank> the Islamic state .
As many experts warn , the first time a drone strike kills a woman or child , a video of <blank> scene and the funeral will be posted for <blank> Muslim world to see .
Even if that video does not actually increase support for the Islamic State , it will convince millions of Muslims <blank> the US is <blank> to its old military tricks : bombing for oil , or <blank> Israel , or simply to crush all Muslims .
Those <blank> @-@ American attitudes , newly hardened once again , will make it much more difficult to get the necessary intelligence against the Islamic State on the ground and to deprive them of <blank> support of <blank> Sunni militias .
That will not just hurt the US in Syria and Iraq . It will shape popular views in other Arab <blank> , limiting their governments &quot; ability to work with <blank> <blank> .
Most damaging of all , a purely <blank> justification for military action - in defense of core US interests - leaves no room to do what actually needs <blank> be done in Syria .
The only way to bring Syrian <blank> Bashar al @-@ Assad <blank> the negotiating table is to weaken him and the Islamic State simultaneously .
And <blank> only legal or moral justification for striking his air <blank> , ammunition dumps , or heavy weaponry is the international responsibility to protect his people from him - just as the <blank> helped to protect the Yezidis from the Islamic State .
For , contrary <blank> Obama &apos;s claim , the brutality of the Islamic State is not &quot; unique . &quot;
Assad has killed more than 200,000 people , mostly civilians , in a conflict that started with <blank> <blank> &apos;s torture of children .
Simply talking about the responsibility to protect , as Obama once did , accompanied <blank> even limited strikes - perhaps as punishment for Assad &apos;s reported recent use <blank> chlorine gas against civilians - would change the game quickly .
Iran would understand that America &apos;s restraint in Syria is not indefinite ; Sunni governments could be shamed <blank> the eyes of their own people for not doing <blank> ; and the Islamic State &apos;s narrative of brutality <blank> collide with a narrative of humanity .
The fate of peasants has a direct and <blank> impact on that of kings .
Obama &apos;s policy wavers between geopolitical calculations based on national interest <blank> the rhetoric of universal values , of standing for &quot; our <blank> security and common humanity . &quot;
Making <blank> rhetoric real would buy him the room for maneuver that is needed to pursue <blank> policy &apos;s geopolitical goals .
WASHINGTON , DC - After 16 days of closed museums , <blank> @-@ empty federal buildings , unnaturally quiet streets , and tens of thousands of workers left in existential limbo , the lights <blank> back on in Washington .
But , while the shutdown of the United States government , initiated <blank> radical congressional Republicans seeking <blank> block implementation of President Barack Obama <blank> health @-@ care legislation , is over - at least for now - three enduring lessons have emerged .
First , the next time the eurozone crisis flares up , the US will simply <blank> to bite its tongue ; after all , the shutdown spectacle revealed pathologies no less severe than <blank> that have characterized the European Union &apos;s economic <blank> political negotiations over the past five years .
Irresponsible behavior threatening the health of the global <blank> ?
Political posturing <blank> outlandish claims foreclosing any possibility of compromise ?
Breathtaking brinkmanship and 11th @-@ hour decision @-@ making leaving all bystanders wondering whether this time the cart might in <blank> go over the cliff <blank>
Few countries in recent years <blank> been spared <blank> pain of their domestic political spectacles being broadcast around the world .
The United Kingdom had mass riots in London just two summers ago ; strikes and demonstrations have paralyzed Paris on a regular basis ; Greece <blank> a rising fascist party ; Mexico City has been practically shut down by teachers occupying <blank> central square ; and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan resorted to violence <blank> June to quell weeks of protests against his increasingly autocratic ways .
Among non @-@ democracies , China had the Bo Xilai scandal , which was worthy of a spy novel , with illicit affairs , rampant corruption , murder , and a senior police official &apos;s dramatic quest for asylum in <blank> <blank> consulate .
Against this backdrop , the US government shutdown looks <blank> little different .
Yes , it was a clear symptom of deep political dysfunction , stemming from the politicized demarcation <blank> electoral districts and the distorting effects of <blank> &apos;s campaign @-@ finance system .
Nonetheless , <blank> is noteworthy that the entire crisis played out according to constitutional rules .
Indeed , as the deadline for raising the debt ceiling neared , Henry Aaron , <blank> distinguished senior fellow at <blank> Brookings Institution , pointed out that the US Constitution requires the president &quot; to spend what Congress has instructed him to spend , to raise only those taxes Congress has authorized him to impose , and <blank> borrow no more than Congress authorizes . &quot;
Honoring all three of <blank> legal obligations simultaneously is impossible if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling , but raising the debt ceiling <blank> Congressional approval , though illegal and an impeachable offense , was the least @-@ bad choice .
Even in the face of deeper political polarization than the US has seen in many decades ( and , in <blank> places , a visceral hatred of the country &apos;s first <blank> @-@ American president ) , Americans and their politicians understand that breaking the rules means dissolving <blank> constitutional glue that holds the polity together .
This understanding means that the cure for the <blank> dysfunction will be found <blank> the ballot box rather than in the streets .
<blank> <blank> is this collective commitment to the law governing how political power can be exercised that is the essence of liberal democracy .
<blank> , the second conclusion to be drawn from the US government shutdown is the virtual disappearance of American triumphalism . Chest @-@ thumping exceptionalism has given way to a more sober patriotism , in which ordinary citizens recognize the long @-@ term trends eroding <blank> promise of equal opportunity , particularly the shortcomings that beset the <blank> &apos;s health @-@ care , education , and infrastructure systems .
The anger of Tea Party Republicans ( like the anger of Occupy Wall Street protesters ) reflects a sense that nothing but dramatic , <blank> revolutionary , measures <blank> change the system .
In response , however , more pragmatic voters are increasingly irate about political paralysis and their governing institutions &quot; inability to respond to the preferences of <blank> clear majority of the population . In the midst of the shutdown , the Republican Party &apos;s popular approval rating sank <blank> barely a quarter of the national electorate , a historic low , while the approval rating <blank> Congress as a whole stood at just 5 % .
The final lesson of the shutdown is that political systems <blank> every kind benefit <blank> the addition of women .
Many commented on <blank> critical role played <blank> six women senators - Republicans and Democrats - in reaching the compromises needed to end the crisis .
These <blank> have maintained relationships with one another across the partisan divide , while those among their male colleagues have steadily deteriorated , giving <blank> to competitive grandstanding and vituperation .
Equally <blank> , these women felt - and acted upon - the moral necessity of actually governing .
In the words of Senator Susan Collins , a Republican from Maine who first put <blank> the outlines of a deal and took it to the Senate floor , the shutdown &quot; hurt all the small businesses &quot; around Acadia National Park in <blank> home state , &quot; and that <blank> plain wrong . &quot;
Women are not necessarily better than men <blank> governing , but they <blank> have <blank> perspectives and habits of engagement that can be essential for cutting through the standoffs created by the need to defend male egos .
They are also often more focused on <blank> plight of actual people than on <blank> promotion of grand principles , preferring concrete progress to abstract victory .
From parliaments to peace negotiations , adding <blank> improves outcomes .
The US government is back at work , for <blank> .
Negotiations for <blank> real <blank> that all sides can live with are beginning . And assessments of how the shutdown will affect the Republican Party &apos;s fortunes in the 2014 midterm elections are rife .
<blank> the country &apos;s social and economic divisions will ultimately find political solutions , through elections and the <blank> of millions of Americans to achieve fundamental reforms .
As frustrating and embarrassing <blank> <blank> last several weeks have been , it could have been much worse .
WASHINGTON , DC - <blank> &apos;s government is cracking down hard on Western journalists , threatening not <blank> renew visas for reporters from the <blank> York Times and Bloomberg in retaliation for their reporting on the corruption of senior Chinese officials .
Times columnist Thomas Friedman recently penned an open letter to the Chinese government telling <blank> that , <blank> the top &quot; cause of death of Chinese regimes in history is greed and corruption , &quot; a <blank> press is more likely to help than hurt .
Anyone who holds freedom of the press and freedom <blank> expression to be universal human <blank> will agree with Friedman &apos;s position .
But , in China , politics - including the politics of <blank> - <blank> always intertwined with economics .
Last month , President Xi Jinping announced a set of sweeping economic reforms <blank> the Central Committee &apos;s Third Plenum , setting forth his vision of &quot; the great rejuvenation <blank> the Chinese nation . &quot;
His 60 @-@ point plan included reforms of fiscal policy and the financial sector that would set market interest <blank> on loans and deposits , permit some private @-@ investor participation in state @-@ owned enterprises , increase <blank> role of small and medium @-@ size enterprises , loosen labor restrictions , and introduce property taxes to boost revenue <blank> local authorities .
This renewed embrace <blank> the market , reminiscent of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s original turn to capitalism in 1979 , will be hard medicine for China &apos;s entrenched <blank> and government elites to swallow .
If Xi &apos;s administration is successful - a big if - its reforms may enable China to negotiate <blank> necessary transition from <blank> economy driven by exports and government investment to a more sustainable <blank> model based on domestic consumption .
A <blank> that has lifted hundreds <blank> millions of people <blank> of poverty over the last two decades must now find a way to safeguard and gradually increase those gains while engineering the same miracle for the hundreds of millions still left behind .
<blank> world has a significant economic , political , <blank> moral interest in the success of China &apos;s reform agenda .
In this context , <blank> is <blank> to understand that Xi &apos;s economic reforms are only one ingredient of a carefully crafted cocktail .
The rest of the recipe includes two parts popular social <blank> - an <blank> <blank> the one @-@ child policy for many Chinese parents and the abolition of &quot; reeducation through labor &quot; - and one part political crackdown .
Increased censorship and intimidation of foreign journalists , together with the imprisonment of dissidents and tighter restrictions on dissent , are an effort to ensure that <blank> disruption does not give rise to <blank> rebellion .
To implement his ambitious reform agenda , Xi has taken several steps to consolidate <blank> personal and bureaucratic power .
He has reduced the membership of the Politburo from nine to seven , making it easier to obtain <blank> in <blank> system designed to institutionalize collective leadership .
He has increased the power of the Central Committee , which <blank> chairs .
And he has created <blank> new State Security Council .
To understand how the State Security <blank> could serve Xi <blank> interest in centralizing power , consider the United States .
Without the National Security Council and <blank> Domestic Policy Council , the US president would have <blank> routine way to control and coordinate different bureaucracies .
White House staff working for the National Security Council call meetings <blank> which officials from the State Department , Defense Department , Treasury , Justice Department , and other key agencies hash out <blank> views on a given policy .
But it <blank> the president <blank> staff who guide the outcome and determines the next steps .
Xi &apos;s moves to strengthen <blank> hand have helped to convince observers that he <blank> business with the reform agenda .
Since <blank> Third Plenum ended and the scope of Xi &apos;s reforms has become clear , many China watchers have hailed him as <blank> most transformative leader since Deng .
Time will tell , but <blank> key difference between 2014 and 1979 is <blank> today the Chinese cocktail is spiked with fear .
Evan Osnos , writing in The New Yorker , reports that two <blank> ago , in the midst of the Arab uprisings , a senior official told a meeting in Beijing that if the <blank> government &quot; waver &#91; ed &#93; &quot; in the midst of social @-@ media @-@ fueled global dissidence , &quot; the state could sink <blank> the abyss . &quot;
Recently , Osnos writes , a high @-@ level <blank> diplomat explained the threatened expulsion <blank> New York Times and Bloomberg journalists on <blank> grounds that &quot; the Times and Bloomberg were seeking nothing short of removing the Communist Party from power , and that they must not be allowed to continue . &quot;
That fear is one <blank> the principal forces driving Xi &apos;s reform agenda .
The Communist Party must keep <blank> Chinese economy growing ( even if more slowly ) , while fighting rampant corruption and responding <blank> citizens &quot; demands .
Chinese citizens cannot vote , but they can - and do - <blank> their displeasure known , which places a premium on what <blank> bureaucrats call &quot; stability maintenance . &quot;
Will Dobson , author of The Dictator <blank> Learning Curve , describes the Chinese government <blank> a technocracy whose legitimacy is founded on efficient problem @-@ solving . &quot; When a regime &apos;s legitimacy is derived from its performance , &quot; he argues , &quot; any crisis - and <blank> the party responds to it - can raise existential questions about the regime &apos;s right to rule . &quot;
China <blank> leaders apparently worry that Western @-@ style investigative journalism inside China <blank> trigger just such a crisis .
<blank> any case , they are taking no chances .
They are placing <blank> faith in their ability to wash their own dirty laundry and drive economic , social , and political change <blank> the top down .
And they are less and less willing <blank> play by Western rules .
WASHINGTON , DC - Since the start <blank> his <blank> administration , US President Barack Obama has repeated a simple mantra concerning other countries : &quot; With power comes responsibility . &quot; <blank> has demonstrated repeatedly that it understands and accepts this responsibility ; Germany may now be following suit .
Several weeks ago , German President Joachim Gauck &apos;s opening address to the 50th annual Munich Security Conference reflected on the Federal Republic <blank> evolution over those five decades , a period that gave rise to &quot; a good Germany , the <blank> <blank> have ever known . &quot;
And , because Germany benefits more than most <blank> from the current open , value @-@ based <blank> <blank> , it has , Gauck said , a greater responsibility to defend and extend that order .
Gauck &apos;s speech reflected the thinking in <blank> important new report , entitled New Power , New Responsibility , released by the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik and the German Marshall Fund <blank> the United States .
The report - <blank> product of several months of debate within <blank> German foreign @-@ policy and security community - identifies Germany &apos;s current values and interests as a commitment to &quot; human dignity , freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and to an international order that is based on universal norms . &quot; As Gauck proclaimed , Germany &apos;s &quot; overriding strategic objective &quot; must be the &quot; preservation and continued adaptation &quot; of this <blank> .
To achieve this objective , Germany <blank> become a &quot; shaping power , &quot; a state with the ability to solve problems and resolve conflicts affecting all <blank> part of the international community .
The traditional determinants of states &quot; power relative to other states - geography , demography , economic heft , and military <blank> , coupled with <blank> availability of resources and technological proficiency - remain important ; but <blank> are often insufficient to confer actual influence in international politics .
A shaping power builds relationships and invests in institutions that allow <blank> to work well with others and <blank> create and mobilize &quot; coalitions and networks of like @-@ minded states . &quot;
As a shaping power with an enormous stake in preserving and extending the openness of the international <blank> , Germany has a special responsibility to help integrate <blank> <blank> powers into that system .
<blank> has long sought a seat on the United Nations Security Council , making <blank> cause with Japan , Brazil , and India .
But New Power , New Responsibility suggests a different path , arguing for the reform of the Security Council in a way <blank> would merge the French and British seats into a permanent European seat in a &quot; slightly enlarged circle of permanent members , &quot; while <blank> ensuring European representation among the non @-@ permanent <blank> .
Under this scenario , Germany would play a role in global peace <blank> security through the European seat , as well <blank> serving as a periodic rotating member .
Moreover , Germany recognizes <blank> need to consolidate Europe <blank> voting power and reduce the number of <blank> seats in other global institutions , such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , to make room for emerging powers .
This renewed commitment <blank> <blank> strong and united Europe is the second pillar of a twenty @-@ first @-@ century German foreign policy .
New Power , New Responsibility calls for &quot; deepening &quot; the European Union through measures that would include democratizing <blank> financial decision @-@ making by directly engaging national parliamentarians <blank> exchanging tighter European fiscal constraints on member <blank> &quot; budgets for a European banking union , a eurozone budget , and Eurobonds .
In foreign and security policy , New Power , New Responsibility proposes strengthening the role <blank> the EU High Representative and the role of <blank> European Action Service .
Current EU High Representative Catherine Ashton continues <blank> prove the worth of EU foreign @-@ policy institutions <blank> , for example , brokering a remarkable peace between Serbia and Kosovo <blank> playing a key role in nuclear negotiations with Iran .
Gauck told Germans in no uncertain terms that they <blank> to be willing to use force , at least as a last resort , and reproached those of his fellow citizens &quot; who use Germany <blank> guilt for <blank> past as a shield for laziness or a desire to disengage from the world . &quot;
More controversially , Gauck proclaimed the need <blank> Security Council authorization of any use of force , but also hinted at a Kosovo precedent for possible <blank> intervention in Syria .
As he put it , when the international community confronts a clear <blank> for the use of force to protect <blank> population from its own government , but the Security Council is divided , &quot; the relationship between legality <blank> legitimacy will continue to be awkward . &quot;
The participants in the deliberations that resulted in New Power , <blank> Responsibility split on this question .
Some argued for an absolute requirement of Security Council authorization , <blank> others recognized an imperative to contemplate humanitarian intervention without <blank> authorization in &quot; very narrowly defined exceptional cases . &quot;
US Secretary <blank> State John Kerry also spoke at the Munich Security Conference .
But , by not referring to Gauck &apos;s speech , he missed an opportunity to underline the success <blank> <blank> of Obama &apos;s key foreign @-@ policy tenets : as the US steps back from its role as global policeman and focuses more on diplomacy <blank> force , other countries must step up .
Even more important , Kerry <blank> Obama <blank> do well to think hard about a key lesson embedded in Gauck &apos;s speech and the report behind it .
Countries that want to retain power in <blank> changing global order must learn to share it , which requires accepting and embracing the contours <blank> a new world .
The <blank> administration should think hard about Security Council reform .
It <blank> signal a real willingness to replace an order that reflects the world of 1945 <blank> one that reflects the world of 2015 .
That means supporting <blank> greater global role for all powers <blank> understand and accept real responsibility for maintaining global peace and security .
WASHINGTON , DC - Syria &apos;s civil <blank> has become a wretchedly complicated problem .
As the parties prepare to meet in Geneva for the second round of United Nations @-@ sponsored peace talks , the government has launched vicious barrel @-@ bomb attacks on Aleppo and other cities ; <blank> moderate Islamist rebel groups , including <blank> Free Syrian Army , are openly at war with Al Qaeda affiliates ; and Al Qaeda @-@ linked groups are <blank> fighting among themselves .
Meanwhile , <blank> war &apos;s spillover effects are worsening .
The fighting has heightened instability in the region ; US <blank> European <blank> are streaming into Syria to take up jihad ; and there is a growing consensus that the post @-@ World War I Middle East boundaries <blank> coming undone .
Indeed , the viability of Syria , <blank> multi @-@ ethnic state , is being threatened by multiple armed groups supported by external sponsors - Iran , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Russia , the United <blank> , Turkey , <blank> , and many private donors - who themselves have conflicting aims .
Here are three ways to simplify the equation and maximize the chances that the parties <blank> <blank> Geneva II peace conference will be able to agree on more than the desirability of someday holding a Geneva III .
First , the <blank> important contribution that this conference can make to the possibility of a negotiated settlement and a political transition in Syria is <blank> change the principal parties &quot; incentives .
In the run @-@ up <blank> Geneva II , each party has sought to strengthen its hand at the negotiating table by killing as many adversaries and holding or regaining as much ground as possible . The task now for <blank> @-@ be peace brokers is to halt that dynamic by agreeing on criteria <blank> participation in whatever elections will eventually be held , regardless of whether President Bashar al @-@ Assad remains in power until then .
Those criteria must include <blank> parties &quot; willingness to allow humanitarian aid to flow <blank> all Syrian civilians under their control and an end to war crimes and crimes against humanity , <blank> systematic targeting of medical personnel , starvation of populations under siege , and executions of war prisoners .
Here <blank> UN must reaffirm its &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; doctrine , not as a justification for military intervention , but <blank> a fundamental principle agreed by all countries : governments must protect their citizens .
If Assad &apos;s Ba &apos;ath party cannot uphold that responsibility , it forfeits its own legitimacy as a participant <blank> any <blank> government .
Second , the <blank> community must re @-@ establish the basis for its engagement .
When the Syrian conflict began , <blank> was an internal matter , with UN involvement limited to humanitarian and refugee <blank> .
But now the <blank> has spread across the Middle East , destabilizing Lebanon and Jordan and threatening <blank> fracture Iraq .
The <blank> Security Council is charged with addressing breaches <blank> threats to international peace , a criterion that is now clearly met .
<blank> <blank> permanent member <blank> the Security Council , Russia thus has an obligation to act ; it ( and China ) can no longer hide behind the argument that the UN should not be engaged in Syria &apos;s internal affairs .
At a time when the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi put Russia squarely on the international stage , the US and <blank> Security Council members should plan a series of resolutions that confront the Kremlin with the choice of meeting its responsibility or applying <blank> own leverage <blank> bring the conflict to an end .
Finally , the single most <blank> step that US President Barack Obama could take is to put the credible threat of force back on <blank> table .
In three years of increasingly bloody conflict , the only diplomatic success <blank> achieved when Assad believed that he faced US missile strikes . He suddenly saw the desirability of getting rid <blank> his chemical weapons .
But <blank> experts believe that military force is off the table .
The US public sharply rejected Obama <blank> planned missile strikes to punish Assad <blank> the repeated use of chemical weapons , and a recent Pew poll indicates that a majority of Americans believe that the US &quot; should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they <blank> on their own . &quot;
Obama &apos;s job , however , is to look beyond opinion polls , particularly <blank> it comes to safeguarding national security .
The <blank> has withdrawn from Afghanistan and Iraq , <blank> the gains so painfully won are being reversed .
Al Qaeda is back and is fighting <blank> its own proto @-@ state in western Iraq and eastern Syria , which is far closer to Europe and <blank> US than <blank> caves of Afghanistan .
Perhaps Obama thinks that he or his successor can deal with <blank> threat <blank> the road .
If Al Qaeda operatives begin threatening <blank> US from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , <blank> <blank> will just take them out with drones , as it has done in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Yemen .
But if he is willing to contemplate using force <blank> Al Qaeda without international authorization <blank> the future , why not use drones now <blank> strengthen the moderate Syrian opposition and force Assad into serious negotiations ?
The threat of cruise @-@ missile strikes <blank> September was enough to send Al Qaeda members in Syria scrambling for the hills .
A strike designed to destroy Assad &apos;s air force and prevent him from dropping bombs full of nails on <blank> people would concentrate <blank> mind on a diplomatic solution .
Obama should announce that the US is committed to a <blank> solution in Syria , and that his government will do whatever it can to bring about such a solution <blank> next week &apos;s peace conference and follow @-@ <blank> action .
But if <blank> ceasefire has not been achieved in the next three months , the US should work with regional organizations and all friends of the Syrian people to authorize a set of military strikes <blank> Al Qaeda @-@ linked <blank> and on the killing machine that Assad &apos;s government has aimed at civilians .
The Obama <blank> should make the case for this to the American people in terms <blank> straightforward US security interests .
After all , if Geneva II fails , Geneva III will not be about Syria alone . It will be about how to end <blank> war raging across the entire Middle <blank> .
WASHINGTON , DC - Something changed - or perhaps was revealed - in the <blank> States during the last month .
Many millions more Americans watched the World Cup soccer tournament in English and Spanish than ever <blank> .
True , with the <blank> Cup <blank> end , many are arguing , as usual , that Americans pay attention only every four years - and only when the US is playing .
But this time something was <blank> : <blank> continued to watch even after the US team was eliminated .
Indeed , <blank> a weekday afternoon in the middle of summer , nearly 15 million Americans tuned in to the Brazil @-@ Germany match <blank> the semifinal .
That is more than <blank> usual viewership for ESPN <blank> Monday Night Football , the biggest regular television draw for fans of American football .
Almost every young person at my organization , New America , found ways to watch the <blank> games in the early rounds .
My apartment mate explained that everyone <blank> her office , in the <blank> Department of Education , had used the excuse of a birthday party to watch the US @-@ Germany match .
On the Tuesday afternoon when the US played Belgium in <blank> knockout round , every bar in Aspen , Colorado , was packed .
Of course , Aspen is one of the country &apos;s wealthiest communities , <blank> perhaps not representative of <blank> US as a whole .
But US television showed an enormous crowd of fans in Kansas City following the <blank> @-@ Belgium match on a large outdoor screen .
It was not quite the equivalent of the final match between Italy and France in 2006 , <blank> virtually every small Italian town turned out to watch on the main square ; but <blank> all over the country spent the month ducking out of <blank> and into sports bars .
America &apos;s <blank> embrace of soccer reflects some important ways in which the <blank> has &quot; joined &quot; the world .
For starters , both the US team <blank> the US audience for soccer derive their growing strength from immigrants - many from countries where <blank> sport is a national passion .
For example , in Washington , DC , almost all taxi drivers are newcomers to <blank> .
When my driver was Ethiopian , as <blank> happened , we would commiserate over the national team <blank> defeat by Nigeria in a qualifying round , then celebrate the US defeat of Ghana , and end by agreeing that in four years , or certainly <blank> eight , the US team would be among the world &apos;s best .
In almost every case , <blank> driver would tell me that his <blank> were playing in local youth leagues .
These immigrants are not only providing homegrown soccer talent <blank> US teams ; <blank> are a core part of the expanding US audience for soccer worldwide .
Dan Levy , lead writer for <blank> US sports website The Bleacher Report , points out that most commentators define &quot; American soccer &quot; as the <blank> of Americans who watch American players in US league play .
<blank> tennis fans watch tennis wherever it <blank> played all over the world , and the US audience for golf does not plummet when a tournament is played in the sport &apos;s birthplace , Scotland .
More <blank> watch soccer in the European and Mexican leagues , in English and <blank> Spanish , than watch baseball and ice hockey , traditionally considered two of the &quot; big four &quot; US sports ( along with American football and basketball ) .
For <blank> US , in particular , the World Cup is a great equalizer .
My mother is originally Belgian , though she has <blank> a US citizen <blank> over 50 years ; I still have an uncle , aunt , and cousins in Brussels .
During the US @-@ Belgium match , emails flew fast and thick across the family network , <blank> lots of friendly rivalry .
My mother claimed divided loyalty , because Belgium , after all , <blank> &quot; the David against the mighty Goliath . &quot;
Her three <blank> children all weighed <blank> simultaneously , pointing out that in soccer it is the US that is the underdog .
Where else can the <blank> experience what it is like <blank> be a small country on the global stage ?
Like viewers around the world , Americans rooted for their team together , regardless of <blank> domestic differences .
At a bar in Aspen , where the only open seat <blank> at a table with an older man and his son @-@ <blank> @-@ law ( who welcomed me and offered to put my beer on their tab ) , we cheered and groaned whenever the <blank> got close to scoring a goal or missed a kick .
In <blank> periodic <blank> breaks , we sounded each other out enough to find out that we were definitely in opposing political camps .
Given the <blank> state of polarization in US politics , <blank> think it is likely that in most other settings , <blank> tablemates would not willingly have bought several rounds of beer for someone who spent two years working at the State Department for Hillary Clinton .
Here , <blank> , we <blank> cheering not for our political side , but for our national side .
As <blank> team maneuvered the ball down the field , politics fell away .
<blank> happens at the Olympics , too , of course .
But the Olympics is a smorgasbord of sports , <blank> with its core of devotees , <blank> often cheer on their favorites at the same time , but separately , in different arenas .
And , more often than not , what we are witnessing is individual achievement - the deeply concentrated agility and courage of <blank> downhill racer <blank> the finely disciplined movements of the gymnast - rather than true team effort .
The World Cup allows all of the supporters of <blank> country to <blank> together at one moment for one game between two groups that must , <blank> them , become more than the sum of their parts .
It actually feels incomplete <blank> watch the World Cup alone .
At the end of the game , amid regret over the loss to mighty Belgium but convinced <blank> the US had played a <blank> game , my new friend said : &quot; We need much more <blank> this . &quot;
US exceptionalism <blank> alive and well , of course .
I suspect that we will always call <blank> world &apos;s game &quot; soccer . &quot;
<blank> now we love it , and it is our game , too .
On top of Argentina &apos;s bestseller list is The Myths of Argentine History , Volume Two . <blank> second place <blank> The Myths of Argentine History , Volume One .
Both , of course , are by the <blank> author : Felipe Pigna , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old historian .
It is a rare event <blank> two volumes of the same book top the Argentine bestseller list .
Nevertheless , the same thing occurred with the first and <blank> volumes <blank> The Argentines , another look at our history by Jorge Lanata , one of Argentina &apos;s best known journalists .
Argentina has been on <blank> front pages of the world &apos;s newspapers , with stories describing an economic and social crisis born of debt default <blank> devaluation , unemployment and widespread poverty .
The subplot is inevitably how a Latin American country that <blank> seemed more like Europe developed all the maladies of <blank> Southern neighbors : a state unable to guarantee public health and education ; a growing gap between rich and poor ; the disappearance of the middle class ; and the decline <blank> industrial capacity in favor of producing raw materials .
All of this is undeniable , and yet the <blank> important change in Argentina - one that occurred a <blank> years earlier - went unnoticed .
Argentina had been , since the end of the nineteenth century , <blank> country of the <blank> .
Millions of immigrants arrived with great expectations of <blank> a country - and making it
In the collective imagination , <blank> idea was expressed in the phrase , &quot; The country <blank> we all deserve . &quot;
<blank> immigrants would raise a new generation of doctors , lawyers , and engineers .
For the individual , Argentina embodied <blank> dream that one &apos;s children would live better - and their children even <blank> .
This idea of promise and progress was <blank> to Argentines .
It was the basis for Argentina , the paradigm for <blank> lives and <blank> way of living .
It lasted for nearly a <blank> , until the early 1980 &quot; s .
Since then , <blank> even campaigning politicians have dared to promise a prosperous future .
Slowly , many parents began to accept the fact that their children would <blank> worse off .
The notion of Argentina as <blank> country with infinite promise became a
<blank> lost our organizing principle and no other idea has replaced it .
We no <blank> have a guide , an idea of how to think <blank> our country , <blank> to understand it and how to imagine who we are and who we can become .
It hasn &apos;t been easy living without knowing who we are , and <blank> became even more difficult <blank> live this way as we watched our world crumble .
This absence of animating purpose , of faith in <blank> <blank> , has made us hungry for our past .
Faced with the loss of the nation &apos;s <blank> idea and desperately in search of <blank> new one , millions of Argentines have become interested in their history .
<blank> books tell our history in an odd way .
To begin with , they reject all academic conventions , such <blank> footnotes , graphics , or judicious explanations in favor <blank> agreeable journalistic narratives pitched to a mass audience .
They appeal , above <blank> , to the logic of popular suspicion that perhaps becomes inevitable when a proud nation is suddenly laid low : Pigna , like Lanata , presents a history full <blank> conspiracy , lies , treason , and corruption .
Both books apply to the past <blank> lens that Argentines are accustomed to using <blank> they look at the present : the lens of the press .
If these books can be read as developing a new idea of Argentina , it <blank> the idea that there is <blank> to trust , that everything is fraudulent , and <blank> leeriness must be our worldview .
This is an interesting view - and perhaps a necessary one - <blank> it is <blank> dangerous .
The process of developing and coming to terms with a new national idea cannot begin and end with a rejection <blank> the <blank> concept .
Argentina &apos;s ongoing search is an untold , fascinating story of how we Argentines imagine and define who we want to be in the <blank> <blank> .
In an uncertain age , whoever defines us first , <blank> a politician , an artist , <blank> an intellectual , will merit a prominent place in our history .
NEW HAVEN - For the second time in <blank> years , global economic recovery <blank> at risk .
In 2008 , it was all <blank> the subprime crisis <blank> in America . Today , it is the sovereign @-@ debt crisis made in Europe .
The alarm bells should be ringing loud and clear across Asia - an export @-@ led region that cannot afford to ignore repeated shocks <blank> <blank> two largest sources of external demand .
Indeed , <blank> of these shocks will have long @-@ lasting repercussions .
In the United States , the American consumer ( who still accounts <blank> 71 % of US GDP ) remains in the wrenching throes of a Japanese @-@ like balance @-@ sheet <blank> .
In the 15 quarters since <blank> beginning of 2008 , real consumer <blank> has increased at an anemic 0.4 % average annual rate .
Never before <blank> America , <blank> world &apos;s biggest consumer , been so weak for so long .
Until US households make greater progress in reducing excessive debt loads and rebuilding personal savings - a process that could take many more years <blank> it continues at its recent snail @-@ like pace - a balance @-@ sheet @-@ constrained US economy will <blank> hobbled <blank> exceedingly slow growth .
Even <blank> the now seemingly heroic assumption that <blank> eurozone will survive , the outlook for the European economy is bleak .
The crisis @-@ torn peripheral economies - Greece , Ireland , Portugal , Italy , and even Spain - <blank> already in recession .
And economic growth is threatened in the <blank> @-@ solid core of <blank> and France , with leading indicators - especially sharply declining German orders data - flashing ominous signs of incipient weakness .
Moreover , with fiscal austerity likely to restrain aggregate <blank> in the years ahead , and with capital @-@ short <blank> likely to curtail lending - a serious problem for Europe &apos;s bank @-@ centric system of credit intermediation - <blank> pan @-@ European recession seems inevitable .
<blank> European Commission <blank> slashed its 2012 GDP growth forecast to 0.5 % - teetering on the brink of outright recession .
The risks of further cuts to the official outlook <blank> high and rising .
It is difficult to <blank> how Asia can remain an oasis of prosperity <blank> such a tough global climate .
<blank> denial is deep , and momentum is seductive .
After all , Asia has been on such <blank> roll <blank> recent years that far too many believe <blank> the region can shrug off almost anything that the rest of the world dishes out .
If anything , Asia &apos;s vulnerability to external shocks <blank> intensified .
On the eve of the Great Recession of 2008 @-@ 2009 , exports had soared to a record 44 % of combined GDP for Asia &apos;s emerging markets - fully ten percentage points higher <blank> the export share prevailing <blank> Asia <blank> own crisis in 1997 @-@ 1998 .
So , while post @-@ crisis Asia focused in the 2000 &quot; s on repairing the <blank> vulnerabilities that had wreaked such havoc - namely , by amassing huge foreign @-@ exchange reserves , turning current @-@ account deficits into surpluses , and reducing its outsize exposure <blank> short @-@ term capital inflows - it failed to rebalance its <blank> &apos;s macro structure .
<blank> fact , Asia became more reliant on exports and external demand for economic growth .
As a result , when the shock of 2008 @-@ 2009 hit , every <blank> in the region either experienced a sharp slowdown or fell into outright <blank> .
A similar outcome cannot <blank> ruled out in the months ahead .
After tumbling sharply in 2008 @-@ 2009 , the export share of emerging Asia is back up <blank> its earlier <blank> of around 44 % of GDP - leaving the region just as exposed to an external @-@ demand shock today as it was heading into the subprime crisis three years <blank> .
<blank> - long the engine of the all @-@ powerful Asian growth machine - typifies Asia &apos;s potential vulnerability to such shocks from <blank> developed economies .
Indeed , Europe and the US , combined , accounted for fully 38 % of total <blank> exports in 2010 - easily <blank> two largest foreign markets .
The recent data leave little doubt that Asia <blank> <blank> starting to feel the impact of the latest global shock .
As was the case three years ago , China is leading the <blank> , with annual export growth plummeting in October 2011 , to 16 % , <blank> 31 % in October 2010 - and <blank> to slow further in coming months .
In Hong Kong , exports actually contracted by 3 % <blank> September - the first year @-@ on @-@ year decline in 23 months .
Similar trends are evident in sharply decelerating exports in Korea <blank> Taiwan .
Even in India - long thought <blank> be among Asia &apos;s most shock @-@ resistant economies - annual export <blank> plunged from 44 % in August 2011 to just 11 % in October .
As was true three years <blank> , many hope for an Asian &quot; decoupling &quot; - that this <blank> @-@ flying region will be immune to global shocks .
But , with GDP <blank> now slowing across Asia , that hope appears to be wishful thinking .
The good news is that a powerful investment @-@ led impetus should partly offset declining export growth and allow Asia &apos;s landing <blank> <blank> soft rather than hard .
All bets would be off , however , in the event of a eurozone breakup and <blank> full @-@ blown <blank> implosion .
This is Asia &apos;s second wake @-@ up call in <blank> years , and this time the region <blank> to take the warning seriously .
With the US , and <blank> Europe , facing <blank> roads to recovery , Asia &apos;s emerging economies can no longer afford to count on solid <blank> in external demand from the advanced countries to sustain economic development .
Unless <blank> want to settle for slower growth , lagging labor absorption , and heightened risk of social instability , they must move aggressively to shift focus to the <blank> &apos;s own 3.5 billion consumers .
The need <blank> a consumer @-@ led Asian rebalancing has never been greater .
With the world focused on <blank> , North Korea , and <blank> possible clash with Iran over nuclear weapons , Kosovo has fallen off the radar screen .
<blank> inattention will end soon ; a decision about the province &apos;s fate is looming .
The United States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intent to make the difficult decision before <blank> end <blank> the year <blank> whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia .
This decision - crucial to the future of an unstable region - <blank> test Western determination and unity .
Negotiations this <blank> in Vienna , brokered <blank> the United Nations , showed that an agreed settlement between Serbia and Kosovo on &quot; final status &quot; will not happen .
Talks continue , <blank> , as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council , <blank> are effectively dead .
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo &apos;s independence , because nationalism <blank> the dominant political force in the <blank> .
Indeed , Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , the apostle of Serbian nationalism , <blank> been trying in <blank> way to undermine Kosovo &apos;s interim government .
He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month on a <blank> constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public <blank> .
The main purpose of his new constitution <blank> its preamble , which enshrines Kosovo as an inalienable part <blank> Serbia .
Kosovo &apos;s ethnic Albanians <blank> proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia , no matter how tenuous .
Throughout the 1990 &quot; s , <blank> virtually opted out of Serbian @-@ run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions .
Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO &apos;s subsequent intervention , which ended Serbia <blank> rule and established a quasi @-@ state under UN administration , has <blank> anything other than independence intolerable .
Some time over the next month or two , the Balkan Contact Group - the US , UK , France , <blank> , Italy , and Russia - <blank> consider Ahtisaari <blank> recommendations on Kosovo &apos;s final status and possibly propose a solution to the Security Council , which must make the final decision .
In public , all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo &apos;s final status open , <blank> informally the <blank> and some of its allies have told <blank> two parties that they will propose independence this year .
Some members <blank> the Security Council - particularly Russia and China - are opposed to <blank> skeptical of an imposed settlement , and few governments favor dividing up another country &apos;s territory , however compelling <blank> circumstances .
Whether the Security Council will approve independence largely depends on averting a Russian veto , <blank> will require considerable diplomatic effort .
The nature of <blank> independence bestowed is also important .
An independent Kosovo must be secured and <blank> minorities protected .
Northern Kosovo , now largely under Belgrade &apos;s control , must not be partitioned off <blank> all <blank> name .
In the interest of reducing <blank> blow to Serbia , the Security <blank> must avoid granting independence in ways that are so contorted that the new state cannot effectively function .
If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status , it will produce a GRAVE situation : Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally , and all nations <blank> have to make <blank> their mind whether or not to recognize the <blank> state .
<blank> that happens , it is likely that the Serbs of North Kosovo would declare <blank> own independence .
At a minimum , Serbia <blank> campaign strongly against recognition .
In fact , Serbia &apos;s government <blank> already trying to persuade the West to postpone <blank> decision until mid @-@ 2007 .
It claims that if Kosovo is granted independence , <blank> ultranationalist Radical Party <blank> come to power in the next elections , and believes that holding elections as early <blank> this year will cause the Contact Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council .
Moreover , the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia <blank> Republika Srpska <blank> threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia .
And they continue to push &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; unsuccessfully <blank> # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; for Ahtisaari &apos;s removal in order to prolong <blank> Vienna talks .
The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be a part of <blank> delaying strategy .
Some hope that postponement <blank> stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence .
Many European <blank> countries are worried about <blank> implications of taking away a country &apos;s territory , as well as the impact of Kosovo &apos;s independence on Serbian democracy .
Given Serbia &apos;s political instability , they question the harm of <blank> short @-@ term postponement - albeit mostly self @-@ inflicted .
But delay only offers more room for Kostunica to find ways to make a Security Council decision <blank> <blank> .
Serbian <blank> will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable <blank> , and Serbian politicians will attempt to present this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo .
Likewise , <blank> will be problems establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances .
But failure <blank> proceed definitively now on Kosovo <blank> final status will produce a worse Balkan situation , one that blocks Serbia &apos;s move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU , condemns Kosovo &apos;s ethnic minorities <blank> dangerous ambiguity , and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia .
If Serbia wants to join the West , it must not forsake <blank> opportunity by trapping itself in <blank> nationalist past .
NEW YORK - Conventional wisdom rarely survives a good stress test , and few tests have been as stressful as that <blank> the global <blank> has endured over the past 24 months .
A healthy season of reappraisal has dawned , shining a new light on boom @-@ <blank> notions like the value of opaque markets , the untouchable status of the American consumer , or the wisdom <blank> deregulation .
One piece of bubble wisdom that has escaped relatively unscathed , however , is <blank> assumption that the &quot; BRIC &quot; <blank> - Brazil , Russia , India , and China - will increasingly call the <blank> tune in years to come .
<blank> BRIC notion , coined in a 2003 Goldman Sachs report , is not all bad : at 75 % correct , it scores a good deal better <blank> most economic prognostications of the day .
Yet the economic crisis that began in 2008 exposed one <blank> the four <blank> an impostor .
Set <blank> vital statistics of the BRIC economies side @-@ by @-@ side and it becomes painfully obvious <blank> , in the words of the old Sesame Street game , &quot; One of these things is not like <blank> other . &quot;
The weakness of the Russian economy and its highly leveraged banks <blank> corporations , in particular , which was masked in recent years by the windfall brought by spiking oil and gas prices , burst <blank> full view <blank> the global economy tumbled .
Saddled <blank> a rust @-@ belt infrastructure , Russia further disqualifies itself with dysfunctional and revanchist politics and a demographic trend <blank> near @-@ terminal decline .
Even <blank> <blank> modest recovery in commodity prices over the <blank> six months , Russia &apos;s energy sector has experienced declining production in recent years , due in part to fears among foreign investors of expropriation .
Russia &apos;s sovereign wealth fund , integral in propping up an increasingly re @-@ centralized economy , is <blank> depleted fast .
If negative trends continue , Russia &apos;s reserve fund could eventually <blank> exhausted .
Russia &apos;s fall back <blank> earth , meanwhile , spawned a kind of parlor game among academics , foreign @-@ policy wonks , and educated investors , aimed at replacing <blank> country in the club of major emerging @-@ market economies .
A variety <blank> acronyms has been suggested , from the cutesy BRICET ( adding Eastern Europe and Turkey ) to BRICKETs ( the former plus South Korea ) and - an even greater stretch - BRIMC , which shoehorns Mexico <blank> the mix .
In all of these revisions , Russia survives , despite the writing on its <blank> wall .
While Russia retains the <blank> &apos;s largest ( if somewhat aging ) arsenal of nuclear <blank> , as well as a permanent seat ( and thus veto power ) on <blank> UN Security Council , it is more sick than BRIC .
Purely from the standpoint <blank> economic potential and fundamentals , the <blank> is far stronger for South Korea , a sophisticated economic power whose primary liability is the danger that the regime <blank> its evil twin to the north will collapse and inundate it with hungry refugees .
The same is true of Turkey , with its robust banking <blank> , thriving domestic market , growing importance to Middle <blank> and energy politics , NATO membership , <blank> Union membership bid , and ties to ethnic cousins across Central Asia .
Perhaps the most compelling case of all is that of Indonesia , <blank> world &apos;s largest Muslim state , with a rapidly expanding middle class , relatively stable democratic <blank> , and an <blank> that has been a star performer in Asia despite the global recession .
From an American perspective , Indonesia <blank> <blank> attractive alternative to Russia , which recently has vied with Venezuela for leadership of the &quot; America in decline &quot; cheering section .
Indonesia , moreover , has shown resilience not only economically , but <blank> as a nation .
<blank> spite of its diverse ethnic makeup <blank> far @-@ flung island territory , the country has made a quick transition from military dictatorship and has recovered from myriad challenges and setbacks , including <blank> 1997 Asian financial crisis , the tsunami in 2004 , the emergence of radical Islam , and domestic unrest .
While Indonesia &apos;s per capita GDP remains <blank> , it is a country &apos;s potential <blank> matters in economic affairs , and here Indonesia shines .
Indonesia depends less on exports than its Asian peers ( let alone Russia ) , and <blank> asset markets ( timber , palm <blank> , and coal , in particular ) have attracted major foreign investment .
The government <blank> Jakarta , meanwhile , has taken a strong stand against corruption and moved to address structural problems .
Even demographic trends favor Indonesia , which , with 230 million people , <blank> already the fourth largest country in the world by population - a full Germany ( 80 @-@ plus million ) larger than <blank> .
But catchy ideas die hard , and Russia has moved to cement the <blank> concept <blank> the BRICs into an irreversible reality .
<blank> meeting produced a notable broadside against the United States , as each member declared its desire to unseat the dollar as the global reserve <blank> .
A few months earlier , <blank> four were moved to issue a joint communiqué ahead of the G @-@ <blank> Summit in April noting their shared determination to change the rules of the global economic system .
In the private sector , BRIC index funds have proliferated , though Goldman Sachs has radically hedged its <blank> BRIC bet by introducing a second term - the &quot; Next 11 , &quot; or N @-@ 11 - to <blank> debate .
<blank> sniffs at the idea of demotion , and American officials appear to have decided <blank> steer clear of the semantic debate .
Still , <blank> should surprise no one that Russia lobbied hard for the Yekaterinburg BRIC summit , and footed the bill for <blank> of it as well .
JERUSALEM : The European Union has failed <blank> again .
Its total impotence to prevent war near <blank> heart of Europe was amply proved in Bosnia and Kosovo <blank> the last decade .
Now the European Union has <blank> again failed to respond to <blank> challenge posed by the Haider phenomenon in Austria .
By lifting the half @-@ hearted sanctions imposed by the 14 members of the EU on Austria <blank> February , any talk about Europe standing for a community of values sounds even <blank> hollow than <blank> before .
In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo , Brussels proved itself to be totally irrelevant and impotent when <blank> use of force - <blank> the threat of the use of <blank> - was concerned .
Fine words and mellifluous phrases filled many documents - but when Vukovar was destroyed , Dubrovnik shelled , Sarajevo besieged for years and then the horrible mass murders <blank> Srebrenica occurred - all that the <blank> Union <blank> able to muster were more words and self @-@ righteous indignation .
<blank> then one <blank> argue that the European Union was not a military alliance .
In the end , it proved that - of all <blank> - Machiavelli was right when he argued that even prophets need to be armed in order to be effective : the moral imperative not to allow <blank> genocide @-@ like development in Europe needed the NATO &apos;s armaments <blank> be effective .
When it came to Austria , however , there was a feeling <blank> since this was not a military , but a purely <blank> and moral situation , Brussels - and the Continent @-@ wide political clout signified by it - <blank> be able to prove efficient .
Alas , it failed as dismally as the League of Nations failed in the l930 <blank> .
Let us revisit what the issue <blank> and still is : <blank> the heart of Europe - and in a country burdened by the political ideologies which gave rise to Hitler , himself an Austrian - Jörg Haider and his party revived the political discourse of xenophobia , racism and visceral anti @-@ <blank> sentiment .
It is true that democracies always find it difficult to <blank> their commitment to human rights with their commitment to free speech : it is a delicate path to tread , and there is <blank> easy answer on a legal and constitutional <blank> .
Yet the issue is not legal <blank> constitutional - it is political .
To preserve democracy and human rights , democratic parties have realized that the most effective ways to confront racist <blank> xenophobic parties is <blank> marginalize <blank> exclude them - to treat them as beyond the pale as potential partners for government .
The Austrians are right that Haider @-@ like parties exist in many European countries - <blank> Britain , France , even in some Scandinavian <blank> .
But in <blank> these countries , the <blank> discourse of all democratic parties ostracized these racist groups and parties : British Conservatives have never entered into <blank> alliance with the British National Front ; the same goes for France , where French conservatives have expelled from their own party local leaders who fashioned municipal alliances with Le Pen &apos;s representatives .
This is exactly what the Austrian conservative People &apos;s Party under Wolfgang Schuessel did not <blank> .
Confronted with an election outcome of whether to rejoin the Social Democrats or Haider &apos;s Freedom Party , <blank> made <blank> Faustian pact with Haider .
There may be <blank> <blank> reasons why another alliance with the Social Democrats was not appealing to Schuessel &apos;s party ( for one , he would not <blank> Chancellor in such a coalition ) .
<blank> there are basic values which should have overruled such purely tactical considerations <blank> have prevented Schuessel &apos;s party from joining with Haider .
<blank> is the moral blindness of Schuessel and his party <blank> triggered the response of the 14 members of the EU .
One could argue that the bilateral sanctions imposed by the 14 on Austria were inadequate <blank> even ineffective .
This is besides the point : the point is , what is the <blank> Union , committed to <blank> and human rights , going <blank> do now ?
Let us put it bluntly : the continued participation of Haider <blank> party in a governing coalition in a European country <blank> totally unacceptable .
The language Haider and many leaders of his party have used <blank> the <blank> is informed by <blank> same racist and anti @-@ Semitic discourse that gave birth to Nazism : in the specific Austrian context , it is violently anti @-@ Slav as well as anti @-@ Turkish .
While Haider is careful not to say anything which can be construed as anti @-@ Semitic , his praise for the valor and honor <blank> Waffen @-@ SS veterans as well as comments on Nazi concentration camps clearly suggest <blank> <blank> ideological home is .
Haider and <blank> party deserve to be politically isolated and ostracized .
The EU countries have failed twice in their attempt to respond to this challenge - once <blank> half @-@ hearted sanctions ; now <blank> lifting them .
Continue with <blank> @-@ as @-@ usual , churning out document upon document of bureaucratic mumbo @-@ jumbo , perhaps even continue to give free advice to Israelis and Palestinians <blank> how to work out their differences ?
One wonders <blank> a good European word for chutzpa would be .
At a <blank> when the EU is on the verge of an ambitious project of enlargement to include many Slav and other Eastern European nations , to allow <blank> racist and xenophobic party to be in power in Austria - or anywhere else within <blank> EU - is a continued reminder of the moral bankruptcy of the idea of European unification .
After the l930 &apos;s and l940 &apos;s one would <blank> hoped that European countries <blank> take threats emanating from a kind of language and sentiment expressed by Haider and his party <blank> seriously .
This is <blank> challenge for <blank> leaders now , and one would hope that under the French Presidency , and <blank> the traditions of the Enlightenment being so central to French and European discourse , a vigorous , efficient response will be found .
FLORENCE - <blank> politics has always been something of an experimental laboratory for the industrialized world .
In the 1970 &quot; s , Britain <blank> where the preeminent postwar model <blank> how to manage the economy collapsed .
That model had been based politically on the creation of consensus , and economically on Keynesian demand management . Today , the equivalent collapse has been <blank> the &quot; regulation @-@ lite &quot; regime in which a party that styled <blank> as &quot; <blank> Labour &quot; accepted a powerful role for markets - particularly for largely deregulated financial markets .
In the 1960 &quot; s , Keynesian policies delivered the illusion that everyone <blank> benefiting , with high levels of <blank> and significant wage growth .
Britain was the coolest place on earth , boasting <blank> Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the pastel fashions of Carnaby Street .
But Keynesianism involved continued fiscal expansion , with <blank> offsetting monetary contraction .
By the 1970 &quot; s , it had brought to the United Kingdom large and ultimately unsustainable <blank> @-@ account <blank> , high levels of inflation , and then political gridlock <blank> what to do .
Which group should be the first <blank> make a sacrifice ?
In early 1974 , Edward Heath &apos;s Conservative government <blank> locked in a struggle <blank> the powerful coal miners &quot; union over &quot; who rules Britain . &quot; He <blank> a premature election in February , in which there was no clear winner .
Heath was deeply unpopular . <blank> the opposition Labour Party was not convincing either , and had <blank> in the way of an intellectual alternative .
<blank> simply sought to avoid confrontation with the unions .
<blank> centrist Liberal Democrats appeared to hold the balance of power , and stories circulated of how Heath was prepared to concede <blank> reformed voting system .
He held out the promise of proportional representation , <blank> would ensure a greater number of parliamentary seats for the Liberal Democrats in future elections , in exchange for the party &apos;s support <blank> <blank> new Conservative government .
There appears <blank> be an overwhelming likelihood that the 1974 stalemate <blank> be repeated in the upcoming general election on May 6 .
The political maneuvering <blank> already started , with the unpopular incumbent prime minister , Gordon Brown , today &apos;s equivalent of Heath , bidding for the Liberal Democrats &quot; support by promising a constitutional reform that would give the party <blank> advantages .
<blank> 1974 , the touted Conservative @-@ Liberal Democrat coalition never materialized , <blank> the Liberal Democrats were wary of hitching their fortunes to an unpopular and discredited politician .
The result was a minority government that struggled for <blank> and legitimacy , and in the end offered only policies that provided <blank> real answer to <blank> country &apos;s underlying problems .
Britain today resembles 1974 much more than it resembles 1979 , when the Thatcher revolution <blank> the <blank> on a new path .
There is again a major <blank> problem , the end <blank> a credit @-@ driven boom , and a threat to the banks ( except that it all looks much bigger , owing to the financial system &apos;s massive <blank> and internationalization ) .
Both major <blank> parties look tired , and at the same time as if they are competing to imitate each <blank> .
There is <blank> an ominous resemblance to Italy in 1992 , when both major parties of <blank> previous 40 years , the Christian Democrats and the Communists , simply melted away in a mixture of corruption and intellectual failure .
In the 2000 &quot; s boom , <blank> in the 1960 &quot; s , it looked as if everyone could live <blank> the never @-@ never .
In 1960 &quot; s , it was counter @-@ cyclical fiscal policy that held out the promise <blank> prosperity for all ; in the 2000 &quot; <blank> , it was that individuals rather than the <blank> piled up debt .
The magic of markets made <blank> an individualization of borrowing and consumption .
As <blank> the meltdown of the 1970 &quot; s , it is easy to see how everyone benefited from the recent boom : homeowners saw their houses rising in price , <blank> @-@ welfare payments were expanded , and people seemed swept up in a new wave of 1960 &quot; <blank> @-@ style &quot; Cool Britannia . &quot;
But <blank> , as then , Britain &apos;s future is bleak and overshadowed by debt .
At <blank> same time , the main parties find it hard to address the <blank> &apos;s problems , because they are reluctant to call for sacrifice before an election .
And , because the party programs of the Labour government and the Conservative opposition are <blank> clearly distinguishable , they find it hard <blank> differentiate themselves from the Liberal Democrats .
Both major parties are appealing to the political center , but they will never be as convincing as <blank> political party that really is <blank> the <blank> center , and that is unencumbered by the scandals attached to the past exercise of power .
The course of the electoral struggle so far indicates that <blank> Liberal Democrats will <blank> very well .
Their leader outshines his Conservative and Labour counterparts in television debates and on <blank> campaign trail .
<blank> , Labour and the Conservatives are in a political trap .
The moment they start to disagree <blank> the Liberal Democrats , <blank> will make themselves look extreme and will forfeit voter sympathies .
But <blank> demand for political moderation impedes <blank> search for the radical and painful solutions that Britain needs .
Little wonder , <blank> , that currency markets are treating the likely outcome in Britain - a hung parliament , with no clear majority for any party - as a repeat of the mid @-@ 1970 &quot; s , with no <blank> solution to the country &apos;s underlying economic <blank> on offer .
ROME - A game of smoke <blank> mirrors : <blank> is how Italy &apos;s current electoral campaign appears - both to Italians and the wider world .
Of <blank> , there is nothing new in this : Italy &apos;s political dynamics <blank> always baffled participants and observers alike .
That a small centrist party may now <blank> <blank> courts to postpone the election merely adds to the usual confusion .
But one thing <blank> seems certain this time is the likely result .
Silvio Berlusconi , the leader of <blank> right @-@ wing alliance , will win his third election ( he has also lost twice ) , while the vote for the Senate is expected to produce <blank> draw .
In <blank> case , Berlusconi &apos;s forces could ally themselves with Pier Ferdinando Casini &apos;s centrist Catholic party , or work to form a coalition with their center @-@ <blank> adversary , the Democratic Party , led by Walter Veltroni .
<blank> latter option , once unthinkable , is possible because Berlusconi is not running the type of inflammatory electoral campaign that he <blank> in the past .
The sharp tone and fierce partisanship of the past 13 years have <blank> cast aside .
Berlusconi <blank> to be fully aware of the difficulty of governing Italy .
With <blank> debt expected to stand at 102 % of GDP in 2009 , rising inflation , and growth <blank> just 0.2 % , it will be difficult to keep electoral promises .
Sagging public infrastructure and an inability <blank> attract foreign capital have made the economic outlook <blank> worse .
In addition , while the state @-@ owned companies Telecom , Autostrade , and Alitalia were subject to an extremely interventionist policy by Romano Prodi &apos;s outgoing <blank> , they have little <blank> show for it .
Plans to build <blank> high @-@ speed train connecting Italy with northern Europe continue to experience delays .
The garbage <blank> in Naples remains unresolved putting the international reputation of one of Italy <blank> most famous products , mozzarella , at risk .
With global financial markets in crisis and Europe &apos;s economy softening , the challenges <blank> the new Italian <blank> will only become greater .
Foreign <blank> , too , may prove difficult to manage .
<blank> activism on the part of France and the <blank> Kingdom , along with Germany &apos;s emergence as a central player in <blank> affairs , risk marginalizing Italy &apos;s influence even more .
If Berlusconi returns to office , he will again seek strong cooperation with the United States , the path now being followed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy <blank> <blank> Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
If he succeeds , something like a six @-@ nation &quot; contact group &quot; ( France , the UK , Germany , Spain , Poland , <blank> Italy ) <blank> have formed to determine EU relations with the US .
This <blank> will be needed , because , regardless of who wins the US presidential election , the next American administration is bound <blank> ask for greater EU participation in addressing <blank> conflicts .
But Italy , unlike France , is in no position <blank> substitute the beauty of Carla Bruni , Sarkozy &apos;s <blank> wife , for real prestige .
To achieve that , the country must promote itself as a motor of <blank> European reform , without neglecting the debate on <blank> <blank> states &quot; role in the EU &apos;s economic choices .
Here Italy could join the <blank> nationally minded economic policies now being pursued by France and the UK , to the detriment of <blank> technocrats in Brussels .
The one thing that seems certain <blank> the upcoming vote is <blank> - barring any last @-@ minute surprises - the billionaire Berlusconi will re @-@ assert his hold over Italian politics .
In fact , he <blank> <blank> Italy &apos;s true ruler for the past 13 years .
Born as a &quot; plastic party &quot; to unite a gamut of political forces following the implosion of the Christian Democrats <blank> 1994 , Berlusconi &apos;s Forza Italia showed itself to <blank> a very cunningly structured movement , with a <blank> and stable consensus among its members on core doctrine .
In <blank> election , Berlusconi decided <blank> open the door to Gianfranco Fini &apos;s right @-@ wing National Alliance , with which he founded a new group , People of Freedom - the only party allied <blank> Umberto Bossi &apos;s Northern League - in an effort to ensure that the government is backed by an even stronger and more cohesive core party .
The Catholics of <blank> Union of Christian and Center Democrats and the <blank> @-@ fascist right of Francesco Storace have left the coalition .
<blank> similar choice was made on <blank> left by Veltroni , whose Democratic Party is now allied with Antonio Di Pietro &apos;s Italy of Values Party .
The Communist Party and the Socialists have <blank> the coalition that Prodi forged to gain his parliamentary majority .
<blank> purpose of this realignment was to create <blank> stable large parties , but further changes are likely .
Strong pan @-@ European center @-@ right and center @-@ left political parties are likely to contest the European Parliament elections in <blank> spring <blank> 2009 .
<blank> Europe presses ahead with reform , the question for Italy is whether smoke and mirrors is all its <blank> have to offer .
Another Roller Coaster Ride for Exchange Rates <blank> 2009 ?
CAMBRIDGE - 2008 <blank> been an exceptionally tumultuous year for exchange rates .
The <blank> dollar soared , the Japanese yen went into orbit , <blank> euro fell to earth , and the British pound crashed , leaving a giant crater .
Emerging @-@ market currencies were hammered , as were &quot; commodity currencies &quot; such as the Canadian , Australian , and <blank> Zealand dollars , and the South <blank> rand .
Indeed , the <blank> of any country that is significantly dependent on commodity exports has suffered .
So , what will <blank> New Year bring for exchange rates ?
While the only safe bet <blank> continuing high volatility , we are at an unusual juncture where the short- and long @-@ term trends appear to be very <blank> .
In the short run , the yen and <blank> <blank> continue to benefit from a flight to safety , as panicked investors seek a place to hide .
The yen and dollar are also <blank> bolstered as central <blank> elsewhere continue to cut interest rates towards zero , territory that the yen and dollar policy rates already occupy .
Thus , even though the United States and Japan will not <blank> raising interest rates anytime soon , lower foreign <blank> still make the dollar and yen relatively more attractive .
Commodity prices will <blank> to be soft , pulling down commodity currencies , and bolstering the yen especially , since resource @-@ poor <blank> is so reliant on commodity imports .
Normally , short @-@ run and long @-@ run exchange @-@ <blank> trends point in the same direction .
Indeed , a huge body of research shows that for <blank> major currencies , the best forecast of next week <blank> exchange rate , next month &apos;s exchange rate , or even next year &apos;s exchange rate is simply <blank> &apos;s exchange rate .
<blank> continuing financial crisis is putting steady upward pressure on the dollar thanks to its safe haven status .
Yet <blank> financial crisis will eventually end , as will the <blank> recession .
Neither will end soon , mind <blank> , perhaps not for another seven or eight months , if not longer .
But , when more normal growth does resume , the <blank> trends underpinning dollar and yen appreciation will disappear .
Perhaps international investors will be grateful to the US for its aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus , which will accelerate sharply when President @-@ elect Barack <blank> takes office <blank> January 20 .
But investors will still worry about what happens when the bills <blank> due .
Many emerging markets will <blank> want to engage in countercyclical macroeconomic <blank> , but they are hemmed in by concerns of fiscal sustainability and fear of rampant inflation .
European <blank> policy is constrained by the Maastricht Treaty , while <blank> monetary policy is rather single @-@ mindedly devoted to price stability.ampnbsp ;
True , China , with its vast <blank> exchange reserves , has the wherewithal to spend as much <blank> countercyclical macroeconomic policy as anyone .
But China &apos;s rulers <blank> <blank> their highly repressed banking system is vulnerable as the country continues to pursue gradual financial liberalization , and that foreign <blank> reserves may be needed for recapitalization .
Thus perhaps no region will be as expansionary as <blank> US .
For the moment , global investors <blank> get enough of US treasury bills , as collapsing interest rates for <blank> @-@ term US securities demonstrates .
But a lot of this demand is driven by <blank> @-@ term , crisis @-@ fueled fear .
As markets normalize , surely investors <blank> look around and realize that the US has vastly increased its debt in fighting the downturn , possibly <blank> several trillion dollars .
At the same time , today &apos;s falling prices ( or &quot; deflation &quot; ) <blank> eventually morph <blank> inflation as aggressive monetary easing takes its toll on price stability .
Admittedly , some of the major <blank> &apos;s movements during the past year can be regarded <blank> normalizing .
On a purchasing power basis ( a crude measure of what different currencies can buy in terms <blank> real goods ) , the euro <blank> absurdly overvalued at $ 1.60 , just as the yen <blank> absurdly undervalued at over ¥ 120 to the dollar .
Commodity currencies had <blank> come off their meteoric highs .
Thus , <blank> past year &apos;s currency alignments have , <blank> some extent , simply brought relative domestic price levels and exchange rates into better balance .
<blank> by now , emerging @-@ market countries &quot; exchange rates , and even more so commodity currencies , have probably overshot on <blank> downside.ampnbsp ;
Over the long run , globalization <blank> economic convergence will resume , and emerging <blank> and commodity currencies will have to strengthen .
<blank> the same time , the prospect of <blank> US inflation and massively higher US public debt levels must eventually weigh on the dollar , as does the still worrisome US <blank> deficit .
As for <blank> yen , it , too , will suffer from the continuing rise in Japan &apos;s public debt levels , which are already <blank> <blank> highest in the world .
Continuing weakness in the Japanese <blank> will eventually hit the yen .
If today &apos;s constellation of exchange rates represents some excessive dollar and yen appreciation , <blank> against emerging @-@ market currencies , when <blank> will unwind ?
That depends on when you think the financial crisis will abate , and the timing of that <blank> <blank> hard to predict as exchange rates .
But come it <blank> . Then watch for the dollar and yen to boomerang .
The question of how the international community should <blank> with Saddam Hussein , Iraq <blank> ruthless dictator , is rightly the year &apos;s dominant theme .
In one sense it <blank> been answered : the United Nations is and <blank> continue to <blank> involved , and the United States has and will continue to play the leading role .
Containment of Iraq by intervention is the method that now seems most <blank> .
In the process of reaching this decision , however , several <blank> simmering issues have come to <blank> fore .
One , of course , concerns the supposed &quot; clash <blank> civilisations &quot; : how do we keep a focused and limited conflict between the UN and Iraq distinct from the need to maintain a relationship of dialogue <blank> world religions <blank>
Another question may seem more parochial <blank> some but is <blank> equal significance globally : what are we to make of the differences between Europe and America that have <blank> so manifest in the Iraq debate ?
Is this its <blank> form of &quot; clashing civilizations . &quot;
No doubt , the differences that now exist between America and Europe are profound , and are <blank> confined to <blank> temporary cooling of German @-@ American relations or to a half @-@ serious exchange of invectives about &quot; gun @-@ slinging America &quot; and &quot; <blank> Europe . &quot;
Indeed , even intellectuals are caught up in <blank> emotional undertones .
<blank> the British historian Timothy Garton Ash , writing in the New York Review of Books , distinguished the US and Europe by paraphrasing the title of <blank> bestselling book , saying that &quot; Americans are from Mars , Europeans are from Venus , &quot; some American readers objected to the sexual portrayal of an effiminate Europe and a macho <blank> .
Yet Garton Ash is <blank> the most pro @-@ American Europeans , <blank> views of <blank> united Europe are closer to those of his many friends in the &quot; new , &quot; postcommunist Europe than to those of France or Germany .
But views about what Europe is and <blank> be are actually at the heart of today &apos;s <blank> @-@ Americanism .
The countries of Europe are moving inexorably towards the &quot; <blank> closer union &quot; that the founding Treaty of Rome demands .
There is <blank> single market , crowned--at least for most EU members--by a single <blank> ; there <blank> a constitutional convention that will propose a new basic treaty , perhaps by mid @-@ June ; there are ambitious plans for a common foreign and security policy and other common policies .
One problem--probably the most fundamental--is that European integration no longer fires the imagination <blank> Europeans .
There are still Euro @-@ enthusiasts , but among the peoples <blank> Europe indifference and , <blank> some places , mild hostility , prevails .
Even the common currency has so far not really caught <blank> ; it is useful , <blank> somehow &quot; foreign . &quot;
Underneath all this is the niggling question : why are we doing all <blank> ?
<blank> is the compelling reason that provides the driving force behind &quot; ever closer union &quot; ?
In the 1950s , the answer <blank> simple : Europeans should never go to war <blank> each other again .
On the contrary , they need to stand <blank> against the Communist threat .
Fifty years later , these goals are <blank> longer relevant .
Economic union has benefited many ; but <blank> is not the type of driving force that inspires .
More recently , the idea of <blank> &quot; European identity &quot; has been in vogue .
This <blank> the point at which many begin to <blank> language that defines Europe by distinction , indeed by contrast , to the US--Europe as the anti @-@ America .
Throughout the Cold <blank> , what was then the Soviet Union provided a
Comparing and contrasting the <blank> sides of the Atlantic has a long pedigree , of course .
European culture and American commerce , <blank> profundity and American materialism--these are ancient and tired themes .
<blank> point to <blank> they regard as America &apos;s unfettered capitalism and hold up Europe &apos;s social market economies against it .
Internationally , Europe likes multilateral arrangements , whereas America prefers <blank> go it alone .
From the other stereotypical point @-@ of @-@ view , Europe wallows in the complexity of issues whereas America likes simple lines <blank> conflict--you are either for us or <blank> us .
It is easy to see <blank> the belief in such differences affects the Iraq debate .
The result is that <blank> leading Europeans begin to define their intentions for the Union <blank> contrasting it to the USA .
The euro must hold its own <blank> the dollar--and hurrah ! --it is now above parity .
European foreign policy <blank> provide a counterweight to that <blank> the hyperpower across the Atlantic .
<blank> closer scrutiny , such facile phrases are deeply disturbing .
The eight ( and now nine <blank> more ) governments that signed the Aznar / Berlusconi / Blair statement supporting the <blank> realized this .
<blank> insisted on undivided Western values , the values of enlightenment and liberty .
These values are shared between Europe and America--and <blank> others--and they are worth defending in an alliance .
When it comes to values , any attempt to divide <blank> <blank> and the European traditions is misguided .
It may be that these shared values make it <blank> difficult <blank> find the much @-@ desired European identity .
But feeding anti @-@ American sentiment , however unintentionally , <blank> the European construction <blank> be intellectually dishonest , morally suspect , and politically dangerous for all freedom @-@ loving Europeans .
SINGAPORE - The British shadow minister for Europe , Pat McFadden , recently warned members of his Labour Party <blank> they <blank> try to make the most of the global economy and not treat immigration like <blank> disease .
As he put it , &quot; You can feed <blank> people &apos;s grievances or you can give <blank> a chance .
And I think our policies should be <blank> giving people a chance . &quot;
In a world increasingly dominated by grievances - <blank> immigrants , bankers , Muslims , &quot; liberal elites , &quot; &quot; Eurocrats , &quot; cosmopolitans , or anything else that seems vaguely alien - <blank> wise words are rare .
In the United States , Republicans - backed by their Tea Party activists - are threatening to close the government down just because President Barack Obama <blank> offered undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked in the US for <blank> years a chance <blank> gain citizenship .
The United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) wants to introduce <blank> five @-@ year ban on immigration for permanent settlement .
Russia &apos;s deputy prime minister , Dmitry Rogozin , once released a video promising to &quot; clean <blank> rubbish &quot; - meaning migrant workers , mostly from former Soviet republics - &quot; away from Moscow . &quot;
<blank> the once famously tolerant Dutch and Danes are increasingly voting for parties <blank> fulminate against the scourge of immigration .
Always keen to assert the freedom to insult Muslims , <blank> Dutch Freedom Party wants to ban all mosques .
<blank> the tiny and much @-@ harassed opposition parties in Singapore - a country where almost everyone is descended <blank> immigrants - are gaining traction by appealing to popular gripes about immigrants ( mostly from India and <blank> ) who are supposedly taking jobs from &quot; natives . &quot;
What <blank> American Tea Party enthusiasts , Russian chauvinists , fearful Dutch and Danes , <blank> Singaporean leftists possibly have in common that is driving this anti @-@ immigrant sentiment ?
Retaining one &apos;s job in a tightening economy is undoubtedly <blank> serious concern .
But the livelihoods <blank> most <blank> the middle @-@ aged rural white Americans who support the Tea Party are hardly threatened by poor Mexican migrants .
UKIP <blank> popular in some parts of England where immigrants are rarely seen .
And <blank> of the Dutch Freedom Party &apos;s voters live nowhere near a mosque .
Anti @-@ immigrant sentiment cuts across the old <blank> @-@ right divide .
<blank> thing Tea Party or UKIP supporters share with working @-@ class voters who genuinely fear losing their jobs to low @-@ paid foreigners is anxiety about being left behind in a world of easy mobility , supranational organizations , <blank> global networking .
On the right , support for conservative parties is split <blank> business interests that benefit from immigration or supranational <blank> , and groups that feel threatened by them .
That is why the British Tories are <blank> afraid of UKIP .
Nigel Farage , UKIP &apos;s leader , <blank> less concerned <blank> economic growth than with pursuing his extreme conception of national independence .
On the left , opinion is split between those who oppose racism and intolerance above all and those <blank> want <blank> protect employment and preserve &quot; solidarity &quot; for what is left of <blank> native @-@ born working class .
<blank> would be a mistake to dismiss anxiety about immigration as mere bigotry or apprehension <blank> the globalized economy as simply reactionary .
National , religious , and cultural identities ( for lack of a better word ) are being transformed , though less by immigration than <blank> the development <blank> globalized capitalism .
In the new global <blank> , there are clear winners and losers .
Educated men and women who can communicate effectively in varied international contexts <blank> benefiting .
People <blank> lack <blank> needed education or experience - and there are many of them - are struggling .
<blank> other words , the new class divisions run less between <blank> rich and the poor than between educated metropolitan elites and less sophisticated , less flexible , <blank> , in every sense , less connected provincials .
It is irrelevant that the provincials &quot; political leaders ( and their backers ) are sometimes wealthier <blank> <blank> resented metropolitan elites .
And so they <blank> the bitterness of those who feel alienated in a world <blank> find bewildering and hateful .
Populist rabble @-@ rousers like to stir up such resentments by ranting about foreigners who work <blank> a pittance or not at <blank> .
But it is <blank> relative success of ethnic minorities and immigrants that is more upsetting to indigenous populations .
Americans know that , <blank> too long , whites will be just another minority , and people <blank> color will increasingly be in positions of power .
At this <blank> , all Tea Partiers and others <blank> them can do is declare , &quot; We want our country back ! &quot;
Short of unleashing massive and bloody ethnic cleansing - Bosnia , on a continental scale - Americans and others <blank> no choice but to get used <blank> living in increasingly diverse societies .
After all , <blank> things are still worth protecting .
There are <blank> reasons not to leave culture , education , lifestyles , or jobs completely exposed to the creative destruction <blank> market forces .
McFadden has pinpointed <blank> central solution to globalization &apos;s <blank> : giving people &quot; the tools to reap the benefits &quot; of the globalized world , thereby making the &quot; connected world work better for people . &quot;
The <blank> is that this call is more likely to appeal to the highly educated , already privileged classes than <blank> those who feel disenfranchised in today <blank> global economy .
This is a serious problem for political parties <blank> the left , which increasingly seem <blank> be speaking for the metropolitan elites , while provincial populists are pushing traditional conservatives further to the right by fishing <blank> the dark waters of popular resentment .
<blank> Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court ruled <blank> the case of Sigfried Ellwanger ­ - an editor , author , and notorious Nazi sympathizer - it entered the perilous field where free speech and efforts to contain racism meet .
For years , Ellwanger published anti @-@ Semitic books , such as The Protocols of the Elders <blank> Zion , as well <blank> books of Holocaust denial , such as his own Jewish or German Holocaust : Behind the Lie of <blank> Century .
By a vote of eight to three , the Court upheld his conviction <blank> charges of racism .
Of course , <blank> enormity <blank> the Holocaust ought to have eradicated anti @-@ Semitism for all time .
Elsewhere - <blank> Europe and the United States - anti @-@ Semitism survives among <blank> fringe of neo @-@ Nazis and renegades like Ellwanger , but also , more widely , in milder forms of prejudice .
But punishing someone criminally for being an <blank> @-@ Semite and a racist propagandist raises troublesome issues <blank> different countries approach in different ways .
To <blank> sure , every country places some limits on speech .
As Oliver Wendell Holmes famously <blank> it in a 1919 US Supreme Court decision , &quot; Even the most stringent protection of <blank> speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting &apos; fire &apos; in a crowded theater and causing a panic . &quot;
Banning someone from shouting &quot; Fire ! &quot; in a crowded theater is not the same , however , as convicting him for holding and propagating <blank> opinion , even a despicable one , <blank> as anti @-@ Semitism .
In a democracy , standard restrictions regulate the time , place , and manner <blank> speech in order <blank> prevent imminent violence and civil disorder .
They bar threats against , and harassment of , individuals . <blank> forbid libel and fraud .
Some countries , such as the US , refuse to go further <blank> regulate speech <blank> of its
Why , then , do many countries prosecute <blank> hate speech of racists ?
Why do International Human Rights Conventions stipulate that the <blank> should prohibit speech that supports national , racial , or religious hatred ?
Is any form of race @-@ related speech <blank> anybody finds offensive to be prosecuted ?
Will <blank> prosecutions actually deter hard @-@ core racists ?
No court should convict someone lightly because of the views he espouses <blank> the public sphere .
But Ellwanger &apos;s appeal , <blank> took almost a year for Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court to hear <blank> decide , put Brazil squarely on the side of those who believe that inciting hatred against even a small minority - <blank> as Jews in Brazil - cannot be allowed in the name of freedom of speech .
The Ellwanger case arose because many believe that <blank> @-@ racism laws can be effective in reassuring minorities of their safety and place in <blank> community .
Brazil <blank> a large , pluralist , multi @-@ ethnic country .
Its social fabric , <blank> <blank> of many other countries around the world , depends on mutual trust among citizens .
Constitutional and legal provisions that make practicing racism <blank> crime punishable by imprisonment <blank> great symbolic significance and help insure - indeed , create and secure - social peace .
Defining the offensive racist views proscribed by the Constitution <blank> the first challenge in the Ellwanger <blank> , because the defense denied that anti @-@ Semitism constitutes racism at all .
<blank> Jews , the defense claimed , do not constitute a race .
In <blank> , the Jews are , of course ,
The second <blank> the Court considered was the <blank> between constitutional principles : the clash between freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts and condemnation of Ellwanger for the crime of racism .
The court ruled <blank> , ultimately , freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts , however generously conceived in a democracy , must be balanced against <blank> values , such as reputation , honor , privacy , dignity , and equality .
Ellwanger crossed the line separating free expression <blank> hate speech .
<blank> in the Ellwanger case , restrictions on free expression should be defined narrowly .
But by opting for a balanced concept of free speech , Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court followed precedents <blank> a number <blank> European countries condemning Holocaust deniers , as well the opinion of the committee charged with monitoring compliance with the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and <blank> European Court of Human Rights .
In a world where anti @-@ Semitism and racism fester , where prejudice on national , religious , colored @-@ based , <blank> ethnic grounds foster discrimination , that is <blank> view that best nurtures the <blank> of all .
रोगाणुरोधी प ् रतिरोध के ख ़ िलाफ ़ निष ् पक <blank> ष लड ़ ाई
ब ् राइटन - मौजूदा रोगाणु @-@ रोधी दवाएँ अप ् रभावी होती जा रही हैं । अगर मौजूदा रुझान जारी रहते हैं , तो हम एंटीबायोटिक की खोज से पहले की स <blank> थितियों में दोबारा जी रहे होंगे , जब संक ् रामक रोग प ् रमुख प ् राणघातक थे ।
दवा @-@ रोधी रोगाणुओं की चुनौती का सामना करना कठिन होगा । इसके लिए न केवल नई रोगाणु @-@ रोधी दवाओं के अनुसंधान और विकास में प ् रमुख निवेश की ज ़ रूरत होगी , बल ् कि नए इलाजों को नियंत ् रित और सीमित करने की ज ़ रूरत भी होगी , ताकि उनकी प ् रभावकारिता संरक ् षित रखी जा सके । जैसा कि जलवायु परिवर <blank> तन पर प ् रतिक ् रिया के साथ है , प ् रभावी रणनीति के लिए अंतर ् राष ् ट ् रीय समन <blank> वय की ज ़ रूरत होगी । ख ़ ास तौर से , सरकारी भुगतानकर ् ताओं और वैश ् विक ग ़ रीबों <blank> साथ फ ़ ार ् मास ् यूटिकल कंपनियों की ज ़ रूरतों का समाधान किया जाना चाहिए ।
दरअसल , किसी भी प ् रयास के लिए ग ़ रीबों को जोड ़ ना महत ् वपूर ् ण होगा । निम ् न और मध ् यम आय वाले देश दवा @-@ रोधी जीवों के महत ् वपूर ् ण स ् रोत हैं । भीड ़ -भाड ़ वाले आवास , ख ़ राब स ् वच ् छता , और प ् रतिरक ् षा प ् रणाली को ख ़ तरे में डालना , चाहे वह कुपोषण या HIV जैसे जीर ् ण संक ् रमण के कारण हो , संक ् रमण के लिए उपजाऊ ज ़ मीन प <blank> रदान करते हैं । एंटीबायोटिक का अक ् सर दुरुपयोग किया जाता है या उनकी गुणवत <blank> ता कम होती है , जिससे बैक ् टीरिया को प ् रतिरोध विकसित करने का अवसर मिलता है । एंटीबायोटिक की बड ़ ी मात ् रा का इस ् तेमाल पशुपालन में भी किया जाता है । इस बीच , परिवहन की बुनियादी सुविधाओं में अत ् यधिक सुधार - ग ् रामीण और शहरी क ् षेत ् रों के बीच और देशों के बीच - का मतलब है कि प ् रतिरोधी जीन शीघ ् र वैश <blank> विक पूल का हिस ् सा बन जाते हैं ।
कई असुरक ् षित देशों में , सरकारी स <blank> वास ् थ ् य @-@ देखभाल प ् रणाली माँग पूरा नहीं कर पाती , और विविध प ् रदाता इस खाई को पाटने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं । इनमें चिकित ् सा विशेषज ् ञों से लेकर अनौपचारिक प ् रदाता तक शामिल हैं , जो मुख ् यतः विनियामक ढाँचे के बाहर काम करते हैं । पैबंद वाली इन प ् रणालियों के लाभ भी हैं । उदाहरण के लिए , बांग ् लादेश में एक ताज ़ ा अध <blank> ययन में निष ् कर ् ष निकाला गया है कि अक ् सर बाज ़ ार के स ् टालों से संचालन करने वाले तथाकथित &quot; गाँव के डॉक ् टरों &quot; द ् वारा प <blank> रदान की जाने वाली एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं ने प ् रसवोत ् तर रोगाणुता और बचपन के निमोनिया से मृत ् यु दर में गिरावट लाने में योगदान किया है । लेकिन इसके भी काफ ़ ी सबूत हैं कि प ् रदान की जा रही दवाएँ विविध गुणवत ् ता की होती हैं और अक ् सर उन ् हें बिना आवश ् यकता के ले लिया जाता है । बहुत बार , रोगी इलाज का पूरा कोर ् स नहीं ख ़ रीदते ।
इस पर एक प ् रतिक ् रिया यह हो सकती है कि ऐसे क ़ ानून तैयार और लागू किए जाएँ जिनसे एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ केवल डॉक <blank> टर के पर ् चे पर उपलब ् ध हो सकें । बहरहाल , इसके परिणामस ् वरूप एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं तक ग ़ रीब लोगों की पहुँच गंभीर रूप से सीमित हो सकती है , जिससे संक ् रमण से मृत ् यु दर उच ् च हो सकती है , जो इसे राजनीतिक रूप से अस ् वीकार ् य और इसलिए लागू करने में मुश <blank> किल बना देगा । इसका बेहतर विकल ् प यह होगा कि एंटीबायोटिक इलाजों को बेहतर बनाने के लिए ऐसी नई रणनीतियाँ विकसित की जाएँ जिनसे इन ् हें अनौपचारिक स ् रोतों के माध ् यम से प ् रदान किया जाए ।
शुरूआत करनेवालों <blank> लिए , उन दवाओं पर भरोसेमंद निगरानी डेटा उत ् पन ् न करने के लिए निवेश करने की ज ़ रूरत है जो आ � � संक ् रमण के ख ़ िलाफ ़ प ् रभावी हैं । इलाज के दिशा @-@ निर ् देशों में यह जानकारी शामिल की जानी चाहिए और एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के सभी प <blank> रदाताओं की दी जानी चाहिए ।
इस बीच , उच ् च गुणवत ् ता वाली एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ किफ ़ ायती क ़ ीमतों पर उपलब ् ध कराई जानी चाहिए । नकली उत ् पादों की पहचान की जानी चाहिए और उन ् हें बाज ़ ार से निकाल दिया जाना चाहिए , और गुणवत <blank> ता नियंत ् रित करने के लिए सरकारों , फ ़ ार ् मास ् यूटिकल क ् षेत ् र , और नागरिक समूहों के बीच नियामक साझेदारी विकसित की जानी चाहिए । क ़ ीमतों को थोक ख ़ रीद के माध <blank> यम से कम रखा जाना चाहिए ; कुछ मामलों में , सार ् वजनिक आर ् थिक सहायता भी ज ़ रूरी हो सकती है ।
क ़ ीमतों को कम करने के उपायों के पूरक के रूप में बहुत ज ़ ् यादा इस ् तेमाल को हतोत ् साहित करने की ज ़ रूरत होगी । पैकेजिंग में नवाचार , शायद दवाओं के उचित संयोजन का पूरा कोर ् स उपलब <blank> ध कराना , इलाज के फ ़ ैसले को आसान बना सकेगा । इसी तरह , कम @-@ लागत की नैदानिक प <blank> रौद ् योगिकियों का विकास केवल लक ् षणों के आधार पर इलाज प ् रदान करने की ज ़ रूरत कम करने में मदद कर सकता है ।
सबसे बड ़ ी चुनौती एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के प ् रदाताओं को अपना व ् यवहार बदलने <blank> लिए प <blank> रोत ् साहित करना होगी । इसके लिए , तकनीकी सहायता देने और कार ् य @-@ निष ् पादन की निगरानी के लिए मान ् यता , भुगतान तंत ् र के संशोधन , और मध ् यस ् थ संगठनों की भागीदारी जैसे उपायों की ज ़ रूरत होगी । इन संगठनों में गैर @-@ सरकारी संगठन , धार ् मिक संगठन , सामाजिक उद ् यमी , और दवाएँ वितरित करने वाली कंपनियाँ शामिल हो सकती हैं । इसकी संभावना नहीं है कि ये गतिविधियाँ वाणिज ् यिक रूप से स ् थायी हो सकेंगी , और इसलिए इनके लिए सरकारों , परोपकारी संस <blank> थाओं , और शायद दवा उत ् पादकों से समर ् थन की ज ़ रूरत होगी ।
इस बीच , लोगों को एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के समुचित इस ् तेमाल पर भरोसेमंद जानकारी और सलाह मिलनी चाहिए । यह ख ़ ास तौर से वहाँ महत <blank> वपूर ् ण है जहाँ नागरिक स ् वास ् थ <blank> य की समस ् याओं से निपटने के लिए काफ ़ ी हद तक अपने खुद के संसाधनों पर निर ् भर करते हैं ।
एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के इस ् तेमाल में प ् रणाली में व ् यापक बदलाव लागू करने के लिए राष <blank> ट ् रीय और वैश ् विक गठबंधनों की ज ़ रूरत होगी । एक मुख ् य लक ् ष ् य स ् वास ् थ ् य कर ् मियों और दवा कंपनियों <blank> आचरण के बुनियादी मानक स ् थापित करना होगा जिसमें रोगियों और समुदायों की ज ़ रूरतें प ् रतिबिंबित हों । सरकारों को इस प ् रक ् रिया में प ् रभावी भूमिका निभाने के लिए अपनी क ् षमता का निर ् माण करने की ज ़ रूरत होगी , और दवाओं और नैदानिक प ् रौद ् योगिकियों का विकास , उत ् पादन , और वितरण करने वाली कंपनियों को सहयोगी समाधानों की खोज के लिए सक <blank> रिय रूप से योगदान करना होगा । हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं से सही रूप में लाभ तभी उठा सकेंगे जब हम उनका निष ् पक ् ष और स ् थायी तरीके से प ् रबंधन कर सकेंगे ।
डावोस - 1980 के दशक के मध ् य में जब मैं एक मेडिकल छात ् र था , मुझे पापुआ न ् यू गिनी में मलेरिया हुआ था । यह एक कष ् टकारी अनुभव था । मेरे सिर में दर ् द होता था । मेरा तापमान बढ ़ गया था । मुझमें खून की कमी हो गई थी । लेकिन मैंने दवा लेना जारी रखा , और मैं ठीक हो गया । यह अनुभव सुखद नहीं था , लेकिन सस ् ती , प ् रभावशाली मलेरिया की दवाओं की बदौलत मैं बहुत ज <blank> यादा खतरे में कभी नहीं था ।
क ् लोरोक ् विन की जिन गोलियों से मैं ठीक हुआ था वे गोलियां अब बिल ् कुल काम नहीं करती हैं । यहां तक कि जब मैं उन ् हें ले रहा था तब भी , जिस परजीवी के कारण मलेरिया होता है वह पहले ही दुनिया के कई हिस ् सों में क ् लोरोक <blank> विन का प ् रतिरोधी बन चुका था ; पापुआ न <blank> यू गिनी उन कुछ स ् थानों में से एक था जहां गोलियाँ प ् रभावशाली बनी हुई थीं , और इसके बावजूद वहां भी उनकी शक ् ति कम होती जा रही थी । आज , क ् लोरोक ् विन मूल रूप से हमारे चिकित ् सा शस ् त ् रागार से गायब हो गई है ।
एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं और अन ् य रोगाणुरोधी दवाओं का प ् रतिरोध करनेवाले रोगाणुओं की बढ ़ ती क ् षमता आजकल के स ् वास ् थ ् य देखभाल के क <blank> षेत ् र में सबसे बड ़ े उभरते संकट में तब <blank> दील हो रही है - और यह एक ऐसा संकट है जिसे अकेले विज ् ञान द ् वारा हल नहीं किया जा सकता है ।
अब क ् लोरोक <blank> विन की जगह अन ् य दवाएं आने लगी हैं । तपेदिक की बहु @-@ दवा @-@ प ् रतिरोधी प ् रजातियां , ई.कोली , और साल ् मोनेला अब आम हो चुकी हैं । अधिकांश सूजाक संक ् रमण लाइलाज हैं । मेथिसिलिन @-@ प ् रतिरोधी स ् टैफ ़ िलोकॉकस ऑरियस ( एसआरएसए ) और क ् लोस ् ट ् रीडियम डिफ ़ िसाइल जैसे सुपरबग , तेजी से फैल रहे हैं । भारत में एंटीबायोटिक @-@ प ् रतिरोधी संक <blank> रमणों से 2013 में 58,000 से अधिक नवजात शिशुओं की मृत ् यु हो गई थी ।
आज , मलेरिया का इलाज अक ् सर चीनी जड ़ ी @-@ बूटी से निकाली गई एक दवा - आर <blank> टीमिसिनिन - और अन <blank> य मलेरिया @-@ रोधी दवाओं के संयोजन से किया जाता है । लेकिन इन क ् रांतिकारी दवाओं के क ् लोरोक ् विन की ही तरह अप ् रचलन में होने का खतरा है ; दक ् षिण पूर ् व एशिया में मलेरिया की प ् रतिरोधी @-@ प ् रजातियां होने का पता चला है ।
यह मात ् र चिकित ् सा समस ् या नहीं है ; यह एक संभावित आर ् थिक आपदा है । अर ् थशास ् त ् री जिम ओ नील की अध <blank> यक ् षता में की गई रोगाणुरोधी प ् रतिरोध पर समीक ् षा द ् वारा की गई शोध में यह अनुमान लगाया गया है कि यदि मौजूदा प ् रवृत ् तियां जारी रहती हैं तो दवा प ् रतिरोधी संक ् रमणों से 2050 तक प ् रति वर ् ष दस लाख लोगों की मृत ् यु होगी और अगले 35 वर ् षों में वैश ् विक अर <blank> थव ् यवस ् था को लगभग $ 100 ट ् रिलियन खर <blank> च करना पड ़ ेगा ।
हो सकता है कि यह नाटकीय भविष ् यवाणी भी बहुत कम हो क <blank> योंकि इसमें संक ् रमण के कारण जीवन और स ् वास ् थ ् य की होने वाली हानि की दृष ् टि से केवल प ् रत <blank> यक ् ष लागतें ही शामिल हैं । आधुनिक चिकित ् सा के कई अन ् य पहलू भी एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं पर भरोसा करते हैं । कीमोथेरेपी प ् राप ् त करनेवाले कैंसर रोगी इन ् हें बैक ् टीरिया को दबाने के लिए लेते हैं जो अन ् यथा उनकी कमजोर प ् रतिरक ् षा प ् रणाली पर हमला कर देगा । आजकल जोड ़ ों के प <blank> रतिस ् थापन और सीजेरियन वर ् गों सहित जिन शल ् यक ् रियाओं को नेमी मान लिया जाता है , उन ् हें केवल तभी सुरक ् षित � � � ूप से किया जा सकता है जब एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं से संभावित संक ् रमणों को रोका जाता है ।
दवा प ् रतिरोध के मूल विकास के अच ् छी तरह से समझे @-@ बूझे मामले हैं । यदि रोगजनकों पर विषाक ् त दवाओं का चयनात <blank> मक दबाव पड ़ ता है , तो अंततः वे उसके अनुकूल हो जाएंगे । मैं जिस वैलकम ट <blank> रस ् ट का नेतृत ् व करता हूं , उसने इन तंत ् रों के बारे में शोध , निदान में सुधार , और नई दवाएं तैयार करने में करोड ़ ों डॉलर का निवेश किया है ।
समस ् या का प ् रभावी ढंग से समाधान करने <blank> लिए , इस प ् रयास को जैविक विज ् ञान के दायरे से आगे बढ ़ ाकर दवा के साथ पारंपरिक रूप से न जुड ़ े क ् षेत ् रों तक ले जाना चाहिए । अमीर और गरीब देशों दोनों में ही समान रूप से , हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के नियमित नशेड ़ ी बन गए हैं । प ् रतिरोध का मुकाबला करने की कुंजी यह है कि रोगजनक जिस गति से अनुकूलन कर सकते हैं उस गति को कम किया जाए । लेकिन , एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के अधिक उपयोग और उपचार के लिए आवश ् यक कोर ् स को पूरा न करने के फलस ् वरूप , हम रोगाणुओं का उपयोग अभी पर ् याप ् त दवा प ् रतिरोध को प ् रोत <blank> साहित करने के लिए कर रहे हैं । वास ् तव में , हम रोगाणुओं का टीका लगाकर हम उनके खिलाफ जो प ् रयोग करना चाहते हैं उसे दवाओं <blank> खिलाफ कर रहे हैं ।
यह इसलिए है कि हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं को लगभग उपभोक ् ता वस ् तुओं के रूप में मानने लग गए हैं , क ् योंकि हम डॉक ् टरों से इसकी मांग करते हैं , और हम इसे अपनी मर ् ज ़ ी से लेते हैं या जब हमें ठीक लगता है हम इसे लेना बंद कर देते हैं । यहां तक कि सबसे अधिक सूचनाप ् राप ् त रोगियों द <blank> वारा इन चमत ् कारी दवाओं का दुरुपयोग किया जाता है । यूनाइटेड किंगडम में की गई शोध से पता चला है कि यहां तक कि जो लोग यह समझते हैं कि प ् रतिरोध कैसे विकसित होता है वे अक ् सर समस ् या को इस रूप में बढ ़ ा देते हैं कि वे डॉक ् टर के पर <blank> चे के बिना एंटीबायोटिक लेने लगते हैं या अपनी दवाएं अपने परिवार के सदस ् यों को दे देते हैं ।
ऐसे विनाशकारी व ् यवहार को बदलने <blank> लिए यह आवश <blank> यक होगा कि हम इसके सामाजिक और सांस ् कृतिक कारणों को बेहतर रूप से समझें । इतिहास , मनोविज ् ञान , समाजशास ् त ् र , नृविज ् ञान , अर ् थशास ् त ् र , बाजार अनुसंधान , और सामाजिक विपणन जैसे विषय इसमें मदद कर सकते हैं ।
यह केवल रोगाणुरोधी प ् रतिरोध <blank> लिए ही सत ् य नहीं है । यह इबोला जैसी महामारी के फैलने पर भी लागू होता है । वायरस का मुकाबला करने के लिए उसके जीव विज ् ञान , इसके संचारण के महामारी विज <blank> ञान , और उन दवाओं और टीकों के बारे में ज ् ञान की आवश ् यकता है जिनका संभवतः इसके खिलाफ उपयोग किया जा सकता है । लेकिन इसके लिए उन व ् यवहारों को भी समझने की आवश ् यकता है जिनके कारण यह संक ् रमण लाइबेरिया , सिएरा लियोन , और गिनी में फैल सका ।
यह समझाने के लिए कि ये समाज किन कारणों से इतने कमजोर बने हैं , इसके लिए इन क ् षेत ् रों के हाल के इतिहास के बारे में जानने और यह समझने की आवश ् यकता है कि वहां <blank> लोगों में सरकारी अधिकारियों के प ् रति इतना अधिक अविश ् वास क ् यों है । इबोला को नियंत ् रण में रखने के लिए रोगियों को अलग रखना और मृतकों को सुरक ् षित रूप से दफन करना महत ् वपूर ् ण हैं , लेकिन दोनों को सांस ् कृतिक संवेदनशीलता के साथ लागू किए जाने की जरूरत है - केवल उनके पीछे मौजूद विज ् ञान संबंधी कारणों <blank> स <blank> पष ् टीकरण की नहीं ।
आज के सार ् वजनिक स ् वास ् थ ् य के बड ़ े खतरों के आर ् थिक परिणाम बहुत गंभीर होते हैं । उनके कारण होनेवाले जोखिमों को न ् यूनतम रखने के लिए यह जानना बहुत जरूरी है कि वे सामाजिक , व <blank> यवहार संबंधी और सांस ् कृतिक परिदृश ् य के साथ परस ् पर गुंथे हुए हैं । विज ् ञान शक ् तिशाली उपकरण उपलब <blank> ध करता है । लेकिन इन उपकरणों का प ् रभावी रूप से उपयोग करने <blank> लिए हमें केवल विज ् ञान की ही जरूरत नहीं है ।
BRISBANE - The significance of the upcoming Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Beijing consists <blank> so much in what is on APEC &apos;s agenda as in what transpires <blank> the sidelines .
Meetings <blank> Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama ; as well as Xi &apos;s meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe loom especially <blank> .
These bilateral relationships constitute much of the <blank> undercurrent of East Asian security <blank> <blank> time when the region &apos;s long @-@ term geostrategic stability has come into question .
The core reality is that the <blank> @-@ Pacific region comprises a group of rapidly globalizing twenty @-@ first @-@ century economies sitting on top of a set of nineteenth @-@ <blank> national tensions .
<blank> contradiction matters for the entire world , because the <blank> accounts for some 60 % of global output .
Economically speaking , where Asia goes in the future , <blank> world will follow .
<blank> Asia is home to a multiplicity of unresolved territorial disputes .
It is the epicenter of underlying tensions stemming <blank> China &apos;s rise and its impact on the United States , the region <blank> established power <blank> World War II &apos;s end .
Indeed , many of the region &apos;s territorial disputes pit <blank> against US allies .
More broadly , the region &apos;s rifts are endemic : <blank> divided Korean Peninsula ; territorial disputes between Russia and Japan , China and Korea , and <blank> and Japan ; <blank> unique circumstances of Taiwan ; and conflicting maritime claims in the South China Sea involving China , the Philippines , Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia , Vietnam , and Taiwan .
There <blank> also long @-@ standing border disputes between China and India , <blank> between India and China &apos;s ally , Pakistan .
As <blank> that <blank> not worrying enough , Asia has become the next global arms bazaar , with military outlays <blank> the region now higher than in Europe .
Both the tone and the content <blank> the China @-@ US relationship are a cause for concern .
China argues that it is subject to <blank> US policy of isolation and containment .
It points <blank> America &apos;s &quot; rebalancing &quot; strategy , to military and / or diplomatic support <blank> those countries with which China has bilateral territorial disputes , and US support for Japan &apos;s revision of its post @-@ WWII &quot; <blank> constitution &quot; as a precursor for what China views as significant Japanese rearmament .
The Chinese also see the commercial equivalent <blank> containment in the US @-@ proposed Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership , which includes Japan <blank> excludes China .
Furthermore , Chinese leaders <blank> to what they regards as intrusive US human @-@ rights diplomacy aimed at fomenting political protest within China ( including Hong Kong ) and undermining the regime <blank> domestic legitimacy .
The US , <blank> surprise , disputes these claims .
For starters , the US argues that <blank> is the various states of East Asia <blank> have actively sought American support for their <blank> , owing to their collective concerns about China .
Moreover , the US insists that it is not containing China ( as it did the Soviet Union ) ; on <blank> contrary , China &apos;s economic rise has been facilitated by <blank> to US markets , as well as to global markets through American support <blank> Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization .
On human rights , <blank> US argues that there are indeed fundamental differences between the <blank> countries &quot; political traditions and current systems .
But , in <blank> American view , this is vastly different from an organized national strategy <blank> undermining the Chinese state and its institutions .
For these reasons , the bilateral strategic @-@ trust deficit is <blank> .
Xi , to his credit , has advanced what he describes as a concept for &quot; a new type of great power relationship , &quot; one that seeks to avoid what <blank> have concluded is the near @-@ inevitability of <blank> @-@ term conflict between <blank> rising power ( China ) and the established power ( America ) .
It is imperative that both parties try to close the trust <blank> .
Doing so calls for a framework of what <blank> call &quot; constructive realism . &quot;
Such a framework embraces realism about areas of contention defined by significant conflicting national <blank> and values .
These issues should simply be peacefully managed over time , until sufficient political <blank> has been created in the rest of the relationship to address <blank> directly .
At the same time , it <blank> &quot; constructive &quot; in <blank> sense of identifying areas of sufficient commonality to create new public goods , such as bilateral investment treaties , a non @-@ nuclear Korean Peninsula , and a global agreement on <blank> change .
A constructive realist approach should also begin to sketch <blank> broad outlines of a <blank> @-@ term &quot; common security &quot; concept for East Asia .
The outlook <blank> the China @-@ Japan relationship appears somewhat better .
Just a few months ago , the bilateral relationship had sunk to an all @-@ time <blank> @-@ war low , owing to a toxic cocktail of territorial disputes over the Diaoyu / Senkaku Islands , Japan <blank> handling <blank> its wartime history ( particularly prime ministerial visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine ) , and Chinese fears about Japanese rearmament .
But now <blank> governments appear to have recognized the growing risk of unintended conflict in the seas and airspace around the disputed territories , given the sheer concentration of naval and air assets <blank> a limited space <blank> the absence of effective protocols to manage incidents and prevent them from escalating .
Both sides have concluded that even limited armed conflict <blank> be disastrous .
Moreover , <blank> Japan and China facing increasing economic uncertainty , they <blank> recognized that it makes sense for the world &apos;s second and third largest economies to remove major political impediments to expanded bilateral trade <blank> investment .
For these reasons , barring any last @-@ minute diplomatic indelicacies , the APEC Summit <blank> likely to represent <blank> start of a formal thaw in Sino @-@ Japanese relations .
APEC , an Australian diplomatic initiative launched 25 years <blank> , was originally conceived as an exclusively economic forum .
Fortunately , it has also become <blank> annual forum for <blank> , Chinese , Japanese , and other <blank> to engage with one another on critical questions of long @-@ term strategic stability .
The future of the region <blank> economy and the <blank> economy - and the stability upon which <blank> are predicated - will be powerfully shaped by the outcome of these deliberations .
Appeal for freedom of speech and respect <blank> minority rights in Russia
We <blank> taken aback and dismayed by reports of actions directed against ethnic Georgians in Russia .
These include accounts <blank> the international media that Moscow police have asked schools to draw up lists of pupils with Georgian surnames as part of <blank> search for illegal immigrants , and verifiable cases where Georgian businesses in Russia have <blank> closed .
Knowing the importance to poor families of remittance to Georgia , we are <blank> concerned at reports of measures <blank> block bank transfers .
We feel obliged <blank> emphasize that disputes between governments are not grounds for actions against the civilian population .
We would hope that <blank> leadership <blank> the Russian Federation will affirm <blank> rights of ethnic minorities ; refrain from hostile rhetoric and actions against Georgians ; and ensure that our common democratic values and respectful relations between neighbours are upheld .
I vividly remember <blank> slightly ludicrous , slightly risqué , <blank> somewhat distressing predicament in which Western diplomats in Prague found themselves during the Cold War .
They regularly needed to resolve the delicate issue <blank> whether to invite to their embassy celebrations various Charter 77 signatories , human rights activists , critics of the communist regime , displaced politicians , <blank> even banned writers , scholars , <blank> journalists - people with whom the diplomats were generally friends .
Sometimes we dissidents were not invited , but received an apology , <blank> sometimes we were invited , but did not accept the invitation so <blank> not to complicate the lives of our courageous diplomat friends .
Or we were invited to <blank> at an earlier hour in the hope that we would leave before the official representatives arrived , which sometimes worked <blank> sometimes didn &apos;t .
When it didn &apos;t , either the official representatives left <blank> protest at our presence , or we left hurriedly , or we all pretended not to notice each other , or - albeit on rare occasions - we started to converse with each other , which frequently were the only moments of dialogue between the regime and <blank> opposition ( <blank> counting our courthouse encounters ) .
<blank> all happened when the Iron Curtain divided Europe - and the world - into opposing camps .
<blank> diplomats had their countries &quot; economic interests to consider , but , unlike the Soviet side , they took seriously the idea of &quot; dissidents or <blank> . &quot;
I cannot recall <blank> occasion at <blank> time when the West or any <blank> its organizations ( NATO , the European Community , etc . ) issued some public appeal , recommendation , or edict stating that some specific group of independently @-@ minded people - however defined - were not to be invited to diplomatic parties , celebrations , or receptions .
One of <blank> strongest and most powerful democratic institutions in the world - the European Union - has no qualms in making a public promise <blank> <blank> Cuban dictatorship that it will re @-@ institute diplomatic Apartheid .
The EU &apos;s embassies in Havana will now craft their guest lists in accordance <blank> <blank> Cuban government &apos;s wishes .
The shortsightedness of socialist Prime Minister José Zapatero of Spain <blank> prevailed .
Try to imagine what will happen : at <blank> European embassy , someone will be appointed to screen the list , name by name , and assess <blank> and <blank> what extent the persons in question behave freely or speak out freely in public , to what extent they criticize the regime , or even whether they are former political prisoners .
Lists will <blank> shortened and deletions made , and <blank> will frequently entail eliminating even good personal friends of the diplomats in charge <blank> the screening , people whom they have given various forms of intellectual , political , or material assistance .
It will be even worse if the <blank> countries try <blank> mask their screening activities by inviting only diplomats to embassy celebrations in Cuba .
I can hardly think of a better way for the EU to dishonor the noble ideals of freedom , equality , <blank> human rights <blank> the Union espouses - indeed , principles that <blank> reiterates in its constitutional agreement .
To protect European corporations &quot; profits from their Havana hotels , <blank> Union will cease inviting open @-@ minded people to EU embassies , and <blank> will deduce who they <blank> from the expression on the face of the dictator and his associates .
It is hard to imagine a <blank> shameful deal .
Cuba <blank> dissidents will , of course , happily do without Western cocktail parties and polite conversation at receptions .
This persecution will admittedly aggravate <blank> difficult struggle , but they will naturally survive it .
<blank> question is whether the EU will survive it .
Today , <blank> EU is dancing to Fidel &apos;s tune .
That means that tomorrow it <blank> bid for contracts to build missile bases <blank> the coast of the People &apos;s Republic of China .
The following day it could allow its decisions on Chechnya <blank> be dictated by Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s advisers .
Then , for some unknown reason , it could make its assistance to Africa conditional <blank> fraternal ties with the worst <blank> dictators .
Denying <blank> visa to Russian human rights activist Sergey Kovalyov ?
It is suicidal for <blank> EU to draw on Europe &apos;s worst political traditions , the common denominator <blank> which is the idea that evil must be appeased and that the best way to achieve peace is through indifference to <blank> freedom of others .
Just the opposite is true : <blank> policies expose an indifference to one &apos;s own freedom <blank> pave the way for war .
After all , Europe <blank> uniting in order <blank> defend its freedom and values , not to sacrifice them to the ideal of harmonious coexistence with dictators and thus <blank> gradual infiltration of its soul by the anti @-@ democratic mindset .
I firmly <blank> that the new members of the <blank> will not forget their experience of totalitarianism and non @-@ violent opposition to evil , and that that experience will be reflected in how they behave in <blank> bodies .
Indeed , this could <blank> the best contribution they can make to the common spiritual , moral , and <blank> foundations of a united Europe .
This month <blank> been a bad one for the cause of human <blank> in Europe , as Serbia was allowed to begin its six @-@ month presidency of the <blank> of Europe , the Continent &apos;s oldest political body .
With Serbia at the helm , the Council , which aims to promote human rights <blank> <blank> rule of law , is now overseen by a <blank> that thumbs its nose at the Genocide Convention and harbors an indicted war crimes suspect , former Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic .
Moreover , the European Commission has indicated that it is ready to resume talks aimed at bringing Serbia closer to the European Union as soon as a <blank> @-@ oriented government <blank> formed in Belgrade .
Earlier <blank> year , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) found Serbia guilty of failing to prevent the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men <blank> Srebrenica .
The Court also declared that Serbia will remain in violation of the Genocide Convention until it transfers Mladic - who is believed responsible for some of <blank> worst crimes in Europe since the Second <blank> War - to <blank> International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) in The Hague .
But the EU <blank> ready to ignore Serbia &apos;s disdain for international law .
The EU is understandably eager to support a pro @-@ European government in Serbia , for this might pave the <blank> for Serbia <blank> swallow the prospect of Kosovo &apos;s independence .
That explains why some EU <blank> states are keen to resume the negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement , which were suspended a year ago due to Serbia &apos;s failure to cooperate fully <blank> <blank> ICTY .
The proposed u @-@ turn by <blank> EU means that Mladic &apos;s arrest and transfer to The Hague is no longer <blank> condition for restarting talks .
Of course , Europe needs to sweeten the Kosovo <blank> for Serbia .
But an immediate resumption of negotiations amounts to an <blank> that is all carrot and <blank> stick , damaging the EU &apos;s own credibility .
Indeed , the West <blank> already tried this approach before , with paltry results .
<blank> December 2006 , NATO allowed Serbia to join its Partnership for Peace , even though there were still war criminals at <blank> in the country .
This softer approach <blank> prove counterproductive , as it will not strengthen democratic forces in Serbia .
Just last week , caretaker Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , once hailed <blank> Europe as a great democrat , showed his true colors .
He went so far as <blank> support the election of an extreme nationalist , Tomislav Nikolic , who was an old ally <blank> Milosevic &apos;s , as the Speaker of the Serbian Parliament .
The head of Nikolic <blank> party , Vojislav Seselj , <blank> in the dock in The Hague facing trial for war crimes .
Although Nikolic soon resigned after a new Serbian government <blank> formed , the cabinet &apos;s composition suggests that the EU might be foolish to expect greater cooperation with <blank> ICTY .
By effectively abandoning conditionality , the EU will be rewarding <blank> most intransigent hard @-@ liners in Serbia - that is , the very people <blank> have opposed the arrest of Mladic for years .
<blank> the ICTY &apos;s closure just one year away , there is a risk <blank> Mladic will never be held accountable .
The effect that the resumption <blank> talks might have on the system of international <blank> is no less chilling .
Serbia <blank> leadership of the Council of Europe is a done deal .
But the EU must insist on Serbia &apos;s compliance with the ICTY , <blank> ICJ decision , <blank> its own Copenhagen political criteria .
Mladic must be arrested <blank> talks start , not after .
As <blank> signal <blank> their seriousness , European governments should think twice before they accept Serbia &apos;s invitation to attend the Council of Europe &apos;s festive 1,000th meeting in June .
A minute of silence for the victims of unarrested war criminals might be a more appropriate way <blank> pay tribute to <blank> Council &apos;s core values of human rights and justice than attending the <blank> now being planned in Belgrade .
BERLIN - The world &apos;s task in addressing North Korea &apos;s saber rattling <blank> made no easier <blank> the fact that it confronts an impoverished and effectively defeated country .
On the contrary , it is in such circumstances that calm foresight <blank> most necessary .
<blank> genius of the Habsburg Empire &apos;s Prince Klemens von Metternich in framing a new international order after the Napoleonic Wars was <blank> he did not push a defeated France into a corner .
Although Metternich sought to deter any possible French resurgence , he restored France <blank> prewar frontiers .
By contrast , as Henry Kissinger has argued , the victors in World War <blank> could neither deter a defeated Germany nor provide it with incentives <blank> accept the Versailles Treaty .
Instead , <blank> imposed harsh terms , hoping to weaken Germany permanently .
During the Cuban missile crisis , he did not try <blank> humiliate <blank> win a total victory over the Soviet Union .
Rather , he put himself in Nikita Khrushchev <blank> shoes and agreed to dismantle , secretly , American missiles in Turkey and Italy in exchange for withdrawal of Soviet missiles <blank> Cuba .
Sadly , North Korea has not received <blank> far @-@ sighted statesmanship .
Faced with the North &apos;s dangerous nuclear game , we should ask what would have happened if , over <blank> last 20 some <blank> , the North Korea <blank> had been approached with the sagacity of Metternich and Kennedy .
Of course , North Korea is <blank> early @-@ nineteenth century France or the USSR of 1962 .
In <blank> eyes of <blank> ( including Japanese ) political leaders , it has never amounted <blank> more than a small , fringe country whose economic failings made it appear to be poised perpetually on the edge of self @-@ destruction .
For the most <blank> , world <blank> preferred not to be bothered with North Korea , and so reacted in an ad hoc way whenever it created a security problem .
But now , following the North &apos;s <blank> nuclear tests , and <blank> its improving ballistic @-@ missile capabilities , that approach is no longer tenable .
Perhaps the best chance to address the problem at <blank> earlier stage <blank> immediately after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in 1991 .
Back then , Kim Il @-@ sung - the North &apos;s founder - faced economic collapse , diminution <blank> his conventional military forces , and diplomatic isolation .
In interviews with Asahi Shimbun and The Washington Times in March <blank> April 1992 , Kim clearly expressed a wish to establish diplomatic relations with the <blank> .
But US and South Korean <blank> were not ready to accommodate Kim &apos;s overture .
Their received ideas about <blank> Korea prevented them from recognizing a fast @-@ changing political reality .
If North Korea had reciprocated in <blank> timely manner following US envoy William Perry &apos;s visit to Pyongyang in May 1999 , President Bill Clinton &apos;s policy of engagement with the North might have been upgraded <blank> a push for normalization <blank> diplomatic relations .
Instead , the North procrastinated , sending Vice Marshall Jo Myong @-@ rok <blank> the US only in October 2000 , near the end <blank> Clinton &apos;s presidency .
A few months later , newly elected President George W. <blank> reversed Clinton &apos;s North Korea policy .
<blank> still recall the difficulty that I faced , as South Korea &apos;s foreign minister , <blank> convincing Bush administration policymakers to negotiate with North Korea instead <blank> merely applying pressure and waiting for the North to capitulate .
Back then , North Korea was restarting its Yongbyon nuclear facility and producing plutonium , thus strengthening its bargaining position vis @-@ à @-@ vis the <blank> .
Precious time was squandered <blank> North Korea &apos;s first nuclear test in 2006 .
Though Bush shifted his policy toward bilateral negotiations with the North a few months later , <blank> Kim regime had <blank> much more obstinate .
Indeed , North Korea <blank> behavior has since become even more volatile .
Its sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan <blank> the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island <blank> 2010 were unprecedented , and raised inter @-@ Korean tensions to their highest level in decades .
Today , following the North &apos;s third nuclear test , we seem <blank> have entered <blank> most precarious stage yet , with the regime declaring that it will never surrender its nuclear option .
The first option should be deterrence of <blank> aggression through diplomacy .
<blank> achieving diplomatic deterrence will depend on China &apos;s cooperation , <blank> this requires that China &apos;s vital national @-@ security interests be recognized .
China fears not only the social and economic consequences of a North Korean implosion , but also the strategic consequences of reunification - in particular , that the US <blank> , through <blank> alliance with South Korea , would gain access to territory <blank> its border .
A mere statement by the US <blank> it has no intention to press <blank> military advantage will not assuage China &apos;s fears .
<blank> leaders recall that the US promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev <blank> German reunification and democratic transition in Eastern Europe would not mean eastward expansion of NATO .
<blank> a more concrete undertaking , one that preserves South Korea &apos;s bedrock security concerns , is needed .
Only after its security is assured will China free itself from complicity in North Korean brinkmanship <blank> be better able <blank> control the North <blank> behavior . &amp; # 160 ;
But Chinese cooperation , though necessary , <blank> not resolve the North Korea problem <blank> its own .
A comprehensive approach <blank> recognize the speed of internal change , especially in the minds <blank> ordinary North Koreans .
Simply put , North Koreans are not as isolated as <blank> once were , <blank> have a growing appreciation of their impoverishment , owing primarily to greater trade <blank> closer connections with booming China .
This internal change needs to be encouraged , because <blank> will prove <blank> effective than external pressure in influencing the regime &apos;s behavior .
<blank> such encouragement must be undertaken in ways that do not incite the North &apos;s fears of being destroyed by indirect means . &amp; # 160 ; South Korean <blank> Park Geun @-@ hye &apos;s recent proposal to provide humanitarian assistance despite the recent spike in tension , is a start in the <blank> direction .
The lives <blank> ordinary <blank> Koreans matter as much as the security of North Korea &apos;s neighbors .
A comprehensive approach is required - one that focuses <blank> much on the human dimension as on the <blank> dimension .
It remains to be seen <blank> this <blank> requires more foresight and courage than today &apos;s political leaders in South Korea , <blank> West , and China can muster .
The deaths of Yasir Arafat and of Sheikh Zayd , the long @-@ standing ruler <blank> the United Arab Emirates , continues the generational change that began in 1999 @-@ 2000 , when the leaders of Jordan , Morocco , Bahrain , and Syria died <blank> quick succession .
Across the Middle East people are younger , and <blank> political leaders older , <blank> the world average .
The gradual replacement <blank> <blank> generation of elites by another may be one of the key factors in determining whether or not effective <blank> takes place in the Arab world .
At present , four political generations co @-@ exist <blank> the region &apos;s socio @-@ political map .
The outgoing leadership generation - that of Arafat , King Hussein <blank> Hafiz al @-@ Assad , King Fahd and President Mubarak - was born before 1935 and has determined events in the <blank> East since the 1970 &quot; s .
<blank> leaders came of age and began their careers during the era of decolonization .
They <blank> weaned on Gamal Abdel @-@ Nasser &apos;s pan @-@ Arab nationalism , and the crucial political event for them was the <blank> defeat in the 1967 Arab @-@ Israeli war .
Members of this generation sought a <blank> Arab leadership that <blank> create a balance of power with Israel .
<blank> also believed in - or at least toyed with - forms of socialism <blank> étatism , and did not consider democracy or civil rights to be priorities .
The <blank> generation was born between 1935 and 1955 , and in many respects represents a generation &quot; <blank> between . &quot;
Most benefited <blank> the economic growth and expanded educational opportunities associated with the oil boom <blank> the 1970 &quot; s .
At the <blank> time , political participation remained blocked by the previous generation , which <blank> intended to give up power voluntarily .
Unsurprisingly , many in this generation grew dissatisfied , <blank> not a few began to look <blank> Islamic alternatives to the prevailing political systems .
Rather than determining events in the coming two or three decades , this generation is likely to <blank> sidelined by the next cohort , born between 1955 <blank> 1975 .
This <blank> the generation <blank> Syria &apos;s President Bashar al @-@ Assad , Jordan &apos;s King Abdullah and Morocco &apos;s King Muhammad VI . Some call this the &quot; generation of sons &quot; - sons of leaders who led their states for decades .
This age cohort was not much influenced by <blank> Arab @-@ Israeli wars <blank> the East @-@ West conflict . Instead , their <blank> education included the Gulf War of 1991 and the Arab @-@ Israeli peace process of the 1990 &quot; s , with its crises and breakdown .
Jailed West Bank Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti is as representative of this group <blank> <blank> leaders of Syria and Jordan .
Members of this generation are <blank> acquainted with notions of globalization and economic reform than with socialism <blank> revolution .
Except for <blank> Palestinians , they have never known their countries other than <blank> independent and comparatively stable states .
In the Palestinian territories , the jil al @-@ intifada , the generation of the ( first and second ) Palestinian uprising , will <blank> <blank> the founding generation .
But it is the fourth group that underscores the relevance of generational issues in <blank> <blank> world .
<blank> when combined , the first three generations make up barely one @-@ third <blank> the entire Arab population .
Almost 60 % of all Arabs <blank> younger than 20 , with roughly 70 % below the age of 30 .
This raises a key question : what happens to these Arab &quot; baby boomers &quot; <blank> the generation now coming to power clings to it <blank> tenaciously as the generation of Mubarak , Assad , and Hussein ?
The political generation of Bashar al @-@ Assad , King Abdullah , and Gamal Mubarak - son <blank> Egypt &apos;s ailing president - forms a less coherent picture <blank> that of the outgoing leadership .
In that elder generation , <blank> had pursued military careers , and many of <blank> aides and collaborators were engineers and civil servants .
The socio @-@ professional profile <blank> the new elite is broader .
Economists , bankers , and entrepreneurs as well as of technology <blank> communication experts are common .
There are <blank> <blank> traditional politicians : personalities who see themselves as representatives of particular social or economic interests , not as apolitical technocrats .
This <blank> leadership elite is in many ways <blank> cosmopolitan than its predecessors ; their average level of education is higher ; a few have foreign degrees .
Developments <blank> Morocco , Bahrain , and Jordan certainly seem <blank> suggest that this changing of the guard can help soften rigid political structures and allow for broader participation .
But generational change need <blank> be accompanied by economic <blank> and steps towards political liberalization - witness North Korea under Kim Il Sung &apos;s son , Kim Jong Il .
Indeed , experience gives little reason <blank> presume that a modern way <blank> speaking , willingness to liberalize the economy , and an urge for technological development automatically translates into a democratic opening .
It <blank> more realistic to expect <blank> the new Arab elites will make use of their <blank> &quot; authoritarian institutions , both to overcome resistance to their economic agendas and to consolidate their newly acquired power .
<blank> is anything but a risk @-@ free path .
Without a significant increase in opportunities for <blank> participation , including genuinely competitive elections , the chasm between a predominantly young population and a ruling elite with <blank> narrow generational base will widen .
Such continuing political inertia leaves an <blank> young Arab population prey to the appeal of extremist ideologies , while driving the best and brightest to seek <blank> fortune elsewhere .
The problem <blank> succession in the Arab secular republics highlights their predicament in the transition to a post @-@ revolutionary phase , <blank> succession in regimes that fail to build strong institutions always risks triggering a systemic crisis .
<blank> the decision by some in favor of dynastic succession may be lacking in <blank> , it is not entirely devoid of merit .
Arguably , it is a choice for economic modernization , <blank> an end to <blank> politics of conflict , and for positive political change further down the road .
Years of Western @-@ backed repressive authoritarianism nipped in the bud any potential growth of <blank> liberal alternative to the incumbent Arab regimes , and turned any abrupt move to free elections into <blank> dangerous exercise in Islamic democracy .
A democracy that produces governments led <blank> Hamas , Hezbollah , or the Muslim Brotherhood is inevitably bound to be anti @-@ Western and opposed to an American @-@ inspired &quot; <blank> process &quot; with <blank> .
Syria has already sought to assure <blank> continuity through quasi @-@ monarchic hereditary succession with the move from Hafez al @-@ Assad to his son Bashar .
There are indications that Egypt might follow suit , <blank> Hosni Mubarak &apos;s son , Gamal , taking over .
Likewise , Libya &apos;s Muammar Khaddafi may <blank> succeeded by his son , Seif el Islam .
As products of revolutionary military takeovers , these secular nationalist regimes failed to produce genuine popular legitimacy <blank> have had to fall <blank> on the dynastic succession practiced by the regimes they toppled .
The centrality of hereditary succession in <blank> quest for peace and stability was shown by Hafez al @-@ Assad when he agreed to unprecedented <blank> will gestures aimed at drawing Ehud Barak <blank> Israeli government into a peace deal .
An old and sick man who was to die a few months later , he acted with a sense of urgency to reach <blank> deal that would relieve his inexperienced son of the burden of struggling <blank> the <blank> of the Golan Heights .
Bashar Assad remains essentially loyal to <blank> father &apos;s legacy .
